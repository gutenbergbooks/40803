<div class="DescrHdr2">How the Gouernour departed from Pacaha to Quigaute, and to
Coligoa, and came to Cayas.</div>

<p>The Gouernour rested in Pacaha fortie daies. In all which
time the two Caciques serued him with great store of fish,
mantles and skinnes, and stroue who should doe him greatest
seruice. At the time of his departure, the Cacique of Pacaha
gaue him two of his sisters, saying that in signe of loue that hee
might remember him, he should take them for his wiues: the
ones name was Macanoche, and the others Mochila; they were
well proportioned, tall of bodie, and well fleshed. Macanoche
was of a good countenance, and in her shape and physiognimie
looked like a Ladie; the other was strongly made. The Casiqui
of Casqui commanded the bridge to be repaired, and the
Gouernour returned through his Country, and lodged in a field
neere his towne, whither hee came with great store of fish, and
two women, which hee exchanged with two Christians for shirts.
<!--003.png-->
<span class="pagenum">6</span>
He gaue vs a guide and men for carriages. The Gouernour
lodged at a towne of his, and the next day at another neere a
Riuer, whither he caused canoes to be brought for him to passe
ouer, and with his leaue returned. The Gouernour tooke his
iourney toward Quigaute. The fourth of August, he came to the
towne, where the Cacique vsed to keepe his residencie: on the
way he sent him a present of many mantles and skinnes, and not
daring to stay for him in the towne, he absented himselfe. The
towne was the greatest that was seene in Florida. The Gouernour
and his people lodged in the one halfe of it; and within
few daies, seeing the Indians became liars, he commanded the
other halfe to be burned, because it should not bee a shelter
for them, if they came to assault him by night, nor an
hindrance to his horsemen for the resisting of them. There
came an Indian very well accompanied with many Indians,
saying, that he was the Cacique. He deliuered him
ouer to the men of his guard to look vnto him. There
went and came many Indians, and brought mantles and
skinnes. The counterfeit Cacique, seeing so little opportunitie
to execute his euill thought, as hee went one day abroad talking
with the Gouernour, he shewed him such a paire of heeles, that
there was no Christian that could ouertake him, and he leaped
into the Riuer, which was a crossebow shot from the towne: and
assoone as hee was on the other side, many Indians that were
thereabout making a great crie began to shoote.
<span class="sidenote">Coligoa neere to certaine mountaines
Northwest.</span>
The Gouernour
passed presently ouer to them with horsemen and footemen, but
they durst not tarrie for him. Going forward on his way, hee
came to a towne where the people were fled, and a little further
to a lake, where the horses could not passe, and on the otherside
were many women. The footemen passed, and tooke many of
them, and much spoile. The Gouernour came to the Camp:
And that night was a spie of the Indians taken by them of the
watch. The Gouernour asked him, whether he would bring him
where the Cacique was? he said, he would. And he went presently
to seeke him with twentie horsemen, and fiftie footemen:
and after he had sought him a day, and an halfe, hee found him
in a strong wood: And a souldiour not knowing him, gaue him
a wound on the head; and he cried out, that he should not
kill him, saying, that he was the Cacique: so he was taken,
and an hundred and fortie of his men with him. The Gouernour
came againe to Quigaute, and willed him to cause his men to
<!--004.png-->
<span class="pagenum">7</span>
come to serue the Christians: and staying some daies for their
comming, and seeing they came not, he sent two Captaines,
euery one his way on both sides of the Riuer with horsemen and
footemen. They tooke many men and women. Now seeing the
hurt which they sustained for their rebellion, they came to see
what the Gouernour would command them, and passed to and
fro many times, and brought presents of cloth and fish. The
Cacique and his two wiues were in the lodging of the Gouernour
loose, and the halbardiers of his guard did keepe them. The
Gouernour asked them which way the Countrie was most
inhabited? They said, that toward the South downe the Riuer,
were great townes and Caciques, which commanded great
Countries, and much people: And that toward the Northwest
there was a Prouince neere to certaine mountaines, that was
called Coligoa. The Gouernour and all the rest
thought good to goe first to Coligoa: saying, that
peraduenture the mountains would make some difference
of soile, and that beyond them there might be
some gold or siluer: As for Quigaute, Casqui, and Pacaha,
they were plaine Countries, fat grounds, and full of good medowes
on the Riuers, where the Indians sowed large fields of Maiz.
From Tascaluca to Rio grande, or the great Riuer, is about 300.
leagues: it is a very low Countrie, and hath many lakes. From
Pacaha to Quigaute may bee an hundred leagues. The Gouernour
left the Cacique of Quigaute in his owne towne: And an
Indian, which was his guide, led him through great woods without
any way seuen daies iournie through a desert, where, at euery
lodging, they lodged in lakes and pooles in verie shold water;
there were such store of fish, that they killed them with
cudgils; and the Indians which they carried in chaines, with the
mud troubled the waters, and the fish being therewith, as it were
astonied, came to the top of the water, and they tooke as much
as they listed. The Indians of Coligoa had no knowledge of the
Christians, and when they came so neere the towne, that the
Indians saw them, they fled vp a Riuer, which passed neere the
towne, and some leaped into it; but the Christians went on both
sides of the Riuer, and tooke them. There were many men and
women taken, and the Cacique with them. And by his commandement
within three daies came many Indians with a present
of mantles and Deeres skinnes, and two oxe hides: And they
reported, that 5. or 6. leagues from thence toward the North,
<!--005.png-->
<span class="pagenum">8</span>
there were many of these oxen, and that because the Countrie
was cold, it was euill inhabited. That the best Countrie which
they knew, the most plentifull, and most inhabited, was a
Prouince called Cayas, lying toward the South. From Quiguate
to Coligoa may be 40. leagues. This towne of Coligoa stood at
the foote of an hill, on the bank of a meane Riuer, of the bignesse
of Cayas, the Riuer that passeth by Estremadura. It was a fat
soile and so plentifull of Maiz, that they cast out the old, to bring
in the new. There was also great plentie of French beanes and
pompions. The French beanes were greater, and better than
those of Spaine, and likewise the pompions, and being roasted,
they haue almost the taste of chesnuts. The Cacique of Coligoa
gaue a guide to Cayas, and staied behind in his owne towne.
Wee trauelled fiue daies, and came to the Prouince of Palisema.
The house of the Cacique was found couered with Deeres skinnes
of Diuers colours and works drawne in them, and with the same
in manner of carpets was the ground of the house couered. The
Cacique left it so, that the Gouernour might lodge in it, in token
that he sought peace and his friendship. But hee durst not tarrie
his comming. The Gouernour, seeing he had absented himselfe,
sent a Captaine with horsemen and footemen to seeke him.
Hee found much people, but by reason of the roughnesse of the
Countrie, he tooke none saue a few women and children. The
towne was little and scattering, and had very little Maiz. For
which cause the Gouernour speedilie departed from thence. Hee
came to another towne called Tatalicoya, hee carried with him
the Cacique thereof, which guided him to Cayas. From Tatalicoya
are foure daies iournie to Cayas. When hee came to Cayas,
and saw the towne scattered; hee thought they had told him a
lie, and that it was not the Prouince of Cayas, because they had
informed him that it was well inhabited: He threatned the
Cacique, charging him to tell him where hee was: and he and
other Indians which were taken neere about that place, affirmed
that this was the towne of Cayas, and the best that was in that
Countrie, and that though the houses were distant the one from
the other, yet the ground that was inhabited was great, and that
there was great store of people, and many fields of Maiz. The
towne was called Tanico: he pitched his Campe in the best part
of it neere vnto a Riuer. The same day that the Gouernour
came thither, he went a league farther with certaine horsemen,
and without finding any people, hee found many skinnes in a
<!--006.png-->
<span class="pagenum">9</span>
pathway, which the Cacique had left there, that they might bee
found, in token of peace. For so is the custome in that
Countrie.</p>

<div class="c4">Chap. XXVI.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How the Gouernour discouered the Prouince of Tulla,
and what happened vnto him.</div>

<p>The Gouernour rested a moneth in the Prouince of Cayas. In
which time the horses fattened and thriued more, then in other
places in a longer time, with the great plentie of Maiz and the
leaues thereof, which I thinke was the best that hath been seene,
and they dranke of a lake of very hot water, and somewhat
brackish, and they dranke so much, that it swelled in their bellies
when they brought them from the watering. Vntill that time the
Christians wanted salt, and there they made good store, which
they carried along with them. The Indians doe carrie it to other
places to exchange it for skinnes and mantles. They make it
along the Riuer, which when it ebbeth, leaueth it vpon the vpper
part of the sand. And because they cannot make it, without
much sand mingled with it, they throw it into certaine baskets
which they haue for that purpose, broad at the mouth, and
narrow at the bottom, and set it in the aire vpon a barre, and
throw water into it, and set a small vessell vnder it, wherein it
falleth: "Being strained and set to boile vpon the fire, when the
water is sodden away, the salt remaineth in the bottome of the
pan." On both sides of the Riuer the Countrie was full of sowne
fields, and there was store of Maiz. The Indians durst not come
ouer where wee were: and when some of them shewed themselues,
the souldiers that saw them called vnto them; then the
Indians passed the Riuer, and came with them where the
Gouernor was. He asked them for the Cacique. They said,
that he remained quiet, but that he durst not shew himselfe. The
Gouernour presently sent him word, that he should come vnto
him, and bring him a guide and an interpretour for his iournie, if
he made account of his friendship: and if he did not so, he
would come himselfe to seeke him, and that it would be the
worse for him. Hee waited three daies, and seeing he came not,
he went to seeke him, and brought him prisoner with 150. of his
men. He asked him whether hee had notice of any great
<!--007.png-->
<span class="pagenum">10</span>
Cacique, and which way the Countrie was best inhabited. Hee
answered, that the best Countrie thereabout was a Prouince
toward the South, a day and an halfes iournie, which was called
Tulla; and that he could giue him a guide, but no interpretour,
because the speech of that Countrie was different from his, and
because he and his ancestors had alwaies warres with the Lords
of that Prouince: therefore they had no commerce, nor vnderstood
one anothers language. Immediatly the Gouernour with
certaine horsemen, and 50. footemen, departed toward Tulla, to
see if the Countrie were such, as hee might passe through it with
all his companie: and assoone as hee arriued there, and was
espied of the Indians, the Countrie gathered together, and
assoone as 15. or 20. Indians could assemble themselues, they
set vpon the Christians: and seeing that they did handle them
shrewdly, and that the horsemen ouertooke them when they fled,
they gat vp into the tops of their houses, and sought to defend
themselues with their arrowes: and being beaten downe from one,
they gat vp vpon another. And while our men pursued some,
others set vpon them another way. Thus the skirmish lasted so
long, that the horses were tired, and they could not make them
runne. The Indians killed there one horse, and some were hurt.
There were 15. Indians slaine there, and 40. women and boies
were taken prisoners. For whatsoeuer Indian did shoot at them,
if they could come by him, they put him to the sword. The
Gouernour determined to returne toward Cayas, before the
Indians had time to gather a head; and presently that euening,
going part of the night to leaue Tulla, he lodged by the way, and
the next day came to Cayas: and within three daies after he
departed thence toward Tulla with all his companie: He carried
the Cacique along with him, and among all his men, there was
not one found that could vnderstand the speech of Tulla. He
staied three daies by the way, and the day that he came thither,
he found the towne abandoned: for the Indians durst not tarrie
his comming. But assoone as they knew that the Gouernour was
in Tulla, the first night about the morning watch, they came in
two squadrons two seuerall waies, with their bowes and arrowes,
and long staues like pikes. Assoone as they were descried, both
horse and foot sallied out vpon them, where many of the Indians
were slaine: And some Christians and horses were hurt: Some
of the Indians were taken prisoners, whereof the Gouernour sent
sixe to the Cacique, with their right hands and noses cut off: and
<!--008.png-->
<span class="pagenum">11</span>
sent him word, that if he came not to him to excuse and submit
himselfe, that hee would come to seeke him, and that hee would
doe the like to him, and as many of his as hee could find, as hee
had done to those which hee had sent him: and gaue him three
daies respit for to come. And this he gaue them to vnderstand
by signes, as well as hee could, for there was no interpretour. At
the three daies end, there came an Indian laden with Oxe hides.
He came weeping with great sobs, and comming to the Gouernour
cast himselfe downe at his feet: He tooke him vp, and he
made a speech, but there was none that vnderstood him. The
Gouernour by signes commanded him, to returne to the Cacique,
and to will him, to send him an interpretor, which could vnderstand
the men of Cayas. The next day came three Indians laden
with oxe hides; and within three daies after came 20. Indians,
and among them one that vnderstood them of Cayas: Who, after
a long oration of excuses of the Cacique, and praises of the
Gouernour, concluded with this, that he and the other were come
thither on the Caciques behalfe, to see what his Lordship would
command him to doe, for he was readie at his commandement.
The Gouernour and all his companie were verie glad. For in no
wise could they trauell without an interpretour. The Gouernour
commanded him to be kept safe, and bad him tell the men that
came with him, that they should returne to the Cacique, and
signifie vnto him, that he pardoned him for that which was past,
and thanked him much for his presents and interpretour, which
he had sent him, and that he would bee glad to see him, and
that he should come the next day to talke with him.
<span class="sidenote">The Cacique of Tulla.</span>
After three
daies, the Cacique came, and 80. Indians with him:
and himselfe and his men came weeping into the
Camp, in token of obedience and repentance for the
errour passed, after the manner of that Countrie: He brought a
present of many oxe hides: which, because the Countrie was
cold, were verie profitable, and serued for couerlets, because they
were very soft, and wolled like sheepe. Not farre from thence
toward the North were many oxen.
<span class="sidenote">Gomara Histor. Gener. cap. 215.</span>
The Christians saw them
not, nor came into the Countrie where they were,
because those parts were euil inhabited, and had
small store of Maiz where they were bred. The
Cacique of Tulla made an oration to the Gouernour,
wherein he excused himselfe, and offered him his Countrie,
subiects, and person. Aswell this Cacique as the others, and all
<!--009.png-->
<span class="pagenum">12</span>
those which came to the Gouernour on their behalfe, deliuered
their message or speech in so good order, that no oratour could
vtter the same more eloquentlie.</p>

<div class="c4">Chap. XXVII.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How the Gouernour went from Tulla to Autiamque,
where he passed the winter.</div>

<p>The Gouernour enformed himselfe of all the Countrie round
about: and vnderstood, that toward the West was a scattered
dwelling, and that toward the Southeast were great townes,
especially in a Prouince called Autiamque, tenne daies iournie
from Tulla; which might be about 80. leagues; and that it was
a plentifull Countrie of Maiz. And because winter came on,
and they could not trauell two or three moneths in the yeere for
cold, waters, and snow: and fearing, that if they should stay so
long in the scattered dwelling, they could not be susteined; and
also because the Indians said, that neere to Autiamque was a great
water, and according to their relation, the Gouernour thought it
was some arme of the Sea: And because he now desired to send
newes of himselfe to Cuba, that some supplie of men and horses
might be sent vnto him: (for it was aboue three yeeres, since
Donna Isabella, which was in Hauana, or any other person in
Christendome had heard of him, and by this time he had lost
250. men, and 150. horses) he determined to winter in Autiamque,
and the next spring, to goe to the sea coast, and make two
brigantines, and send one of them to Cuba, and the other to
Nueua Espanna, and that which went in safetie, might giue
newes of him: Hoping with the goods which he had in Cuba, to
furnish himselfe againe, and to attempt the discouery and conquest
toward the West: for he had not yet come where Cabe&ccedil;a de
Vaca had been.
<span class="sidenote">Quipana, fiue daies iournie from Tulla.</span>
Thus hauing sent away the two Caciques of
Cayas and Tulla, he tooke his iournie toward Autiamque: Hee
trauelled fiue daies ouer very rough mountaines, and
came to a towne called Quipana, where no Indians
could be taken for the toughnesse of the Countrie:
and the towne being betweene hilles, there was an ambush laid,
wherewith they tooke two Indians; which told them, that
Autiamque was sixe daies iournie from thence, and that their was
another Prouince toward the South, eight daies iournie off, plentiful
<!--010.png-->
<span class="pagenum">13</span>
of Maiz, and very well peopled, which was called Guahate. But
because Autiamque was neerer, and the most of the Indians agreed
of it, the Gouernour made his iournie that way. In three daies he
came to a towne called Anoixi. He sent a Captaine before with
30. horsemen, and 50. footemen, and tooke the Indians carelesse,
hee tooke many men and women prisoners. Within two daies
after the Gouernour came to another towne called Catamaya, and
lodged in the fields of the towne. Two Indians came with a
false message from the Cacique to know his determination. Hee
bad them tell their Lord, that hee should come and speake with
him. The Indians returned and came no more, nor any other
message from the Cacique. The next day the Christians went
to the towne, which was without people: they tooke as much
Maiz as they needed. That day they lodged in a wood, and the
next day they came to Autiamque.
<span class="sidenote">Autiamque sixe daies iournie from Quipana.</span>
They found
much Maiz laid vp in store, and French beanes, and
walnuts, and prunes, great store of all sorts. They
tooke some Indians which were gathering together
the stuffe which their wiues had hidden. This was a champion
Countrie, and well inhabited. The Gouernour lodged in the
best part of the towne, and commanded presently to make a
fense of timber round about the Campe distant from the houses,
that the Indians might not hurt them without by fire. And
measuring the ground by pases, hee appointed euery one his part
to doe according to the number of Indians which he had: presently
the timber was brought by them: and in three daies there
was an inclosure made of very hie and thicke posts thrust into the
ground, and many railes laid acrosse. Hard by this towne passed
a Riuer, that came out of the Prouince of Cayas: and aboue and
beneath it was very well peopled. Thither came Indians on the
Caciques behalfe with a present of mantles and skinnes; and an
halting Cacique, subiect to the Lord of Autiamque, Lord of a
towne called Tietiquaquo, came many times to visit the Gouernour,
and to bring him presents of such as hee had. The Cacique of
Autiamque sent to know of the Gouernour, how long time hee
meant to stay in this Countrie? And vnderstanding that he
meant to stay aboue three daies, he neuer sent any more Indians,
nor any other message, but conspired with the lame Cacique to
rebell. Diuers inrodes were made, wherein there were many men
and women taken, and the lame Cacique among the rest. The
Gouernour respecting the seruices which he had receiued of him,
<!--011.png-->
<span class="pagenum">14</span>
reprehended and admonished him, and set him at libertie, and
gaue him two Indians to carrie him in a chaire vpon their
shoulders. The Cacique of Autiamque desiring to thrust the
Gouernour out of his Countrie, set spies ouer him. And an
Indian comming one night to the gate of the inclosure, a soldier
that watched espied him, and stepping behind the gate, as he
came in, he gaue him such a thrust, that he fell downe; and so
he carried him to the Gouernour: and as he asked him wherefore
he came, not being able to speake, hee fell downe dead.
<span class="sidenote">Great prouidence.</span>
The
night following the Gouernour commanded a souldiour
to giue the alarme, and to say that he had seene
Indians, to see how ready they would be to answere
the alarme.
And hee did so sometimes as well there, as in other
places, when he thought that his men were carelesse, and reprehended
such as were slacke. And as well for this cause, as in
regard of doing their dutie, when the alarme was giuen, euery
one sought to be the first that should answere. They staied in
Autiamque three moneths with great plentie of Maiz, French
beanes, Walnuts, Prunes, and Conies: which vntill that time
they knew not how to catch. And in Autiamque the Indians
taught them how to take them: which was, with great springes,
which lifted vp their feete from the ground: And the snare was
made with a strong string, whereunto was fastened a knot of a
cane, which ran close about the neck of the conie, because they
should not gnaw the string. They tooke many in the fields of
Maiz, especiallie when it freesed or snowed. The Christians
staied there one whole moneth so inclosed with snow, that they
went not out of the towne: and when they wanted firewood, the
Gouernour with his horsemen going and coming many times to
the wood, which was two crossebow shot from the towne, made a
pathway, whereby the footemen went for wood. In this meane
space, some Indians which went loose, killed many conies with their
giues, and with arrowes. These conies were of two sorts, some
were like those of Spaine, and the other of the same colour and
fashion, and as big as great Hares, longer, and hauing greater
loines.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How the Gouernour went from Autiamque to Nilco,
and from thence to Guacoya.</div>

<p>Vpon Monday the sixt of March 1542, the Gouernour departed
<!--012.png-->
<span class="pagenum">15</span>
from Autiamque to seeke Nilco, which the Indians said was
neere the Great riuer, with determination to come to the Sea, and
procure some succour of men and horses: for hee had now but
three hundred men of warre, and fortie horses, and some of them
lame, which did nothing but helpe to make vp the number: and
for want of iron they had gone aboue a yeere vnshod: and because
they were vsed to it in the plaine countrie, it did them no great
harme.
<span class="sidenote">The death of Iohn Ortiz, and the great misse of
him being their interpretour.</span>
Iohn Ortiz died in Autiamque; which grieued
the Gouernour very much: because that without an
Interpretour hee feared to enter farre into the land,
where he might be lost. From thence forward a
youth that was taken in Cutifachiqui did serue for
Interpretour, which had by that time learned somewhat of the
Christians language. The death of Iohn Ortiz was so great a
mischiefe for the discouering inward, or going out of the land,
that to learne of the Indians, that which in foure words hee
declared, they needed a whole day with the youth: and most
commonly hee vnderstood quite contrarie that which was asked
him: whereby it often happened that the way that they went one
day, and sometimes two or three daies, they turned backe, and
went astray through the wood here and there. The Gouernour
spent ten daies in trauelling from Autiamque to a prouince called
Ayays; and came to a towne that stood neere the Riuer that
passeth by Cayas and Autiamque. There hee commanded a
barge to be made, wherewith he passed the Riuer.
<span class="sidenote">Great snow about the twentieth of March.</span>
When he
had passed the Riuer there fell out such weather, that
foure daies he could not trauell for snow. Assoone
as it gaue ouer snowing, hee went three daies iourney
through a Wildernesse, and a countrie so low, and so
full of lakes and euill waies, that hee trauelled one time a whole
day in water, sometimes knee deepe, sometimes to the stirrup,
and sometimes they swamme. He came to a towne called
Tutelpinco, abandoned, and without Maiz: there passed by it a
lake, that entered into the riuer, which carried a great streame
and force of water. Fiue Christians passing ouer it in a
periagua, which the Gouernour had sent with a Captaine, the
periagua ouerset: some tooke hold on it, some on the trees that
were in the lake. One Francis Sebastian, an honest man of
Villa noua de Barca Rota, was drowned there. The Gouernour
went a whole day along the lake seeking passage, and could
finde none, nor any way that did passe to the other side.
<!--013.png-->
<span class="pagenum">16</span>
Comming againe at night to the towne hee found two peaceable
Indians, which shewed him the passage, and which way hee was
to goe. There they made of canes and of the timber of houses
thatched with canes, rafts wherewith they passed the lake. They
trauelled three daies, and came to a towne of the territorie of
Nilco, called Tianto. There they tooke thirtie Indians, and
among them two principall men of this towne. The Gouernour
sent a Captaine with horsemen and footmen before to Nilco,
because the Indians might haue no time to carrie away the
provision. They passed through three or foure great townes;
and in the towne where the Cacique was resident, which was
two leagues from the place where the Gouernour remained, they
found many Indians with their bowes and arrowes, in manner as
though they would haue staied to fight, which did compasse the
towne; and assoone as they saw the Christians come neere them
without misdoubting them, they set the Caciques house on fire,
and fled ouer a lake that passed neere the towne, through which
the horses could not passe. The next day being Wednesday the
29. of March the Gouernour came to Nilco: he lodged with all
his men in the Caciques towne, which stood in a plaine field,
which was inhabited for the space of a quarter of a league: and
within a league and halfe a league were other very great townes,
wherein was great store of Maiz, of French beanes, of Walnuts,
and Prunes.
<span class="sidenote">The best Countrie of Florida.</span>
This was the best inhabited countrie,
that was seene in Florida, and had most store of
Maiz, except Coca, and Apalache. There came to
the campe an Indian, accompanied with others, and in the
Caciques name gaue the Gouernour a mantle of Marterns skinnes,
and a cordon of perles. The Gouernour gaue him a few small
Margarites, which are certaine beades much esteemed in Peru,
and other things, wherewith he was very well contented. He
promised to returne within two daies, but neuer came againe:
but on the contrarie the Indians came by night in canoes, and
carried away all the Maiz they could, and made them cabins on
the other side of the Riuer in the thickest of the wood, because
they might flee if wee should goe to seeke them. The Gouernour
seeing hee came not at the time appointed, commanded an
ambush to be laid about certaine store-houses neere the lake,
whither the Indians came for Maiz: where they tooke two
Indians, who told the Gouernour, that hee which came to visit
him, was not the Cacique, but was sent by him vnder pretence
<!--014.png-->
<span class="pagenum">17</span>
to spie whether the Christians were carelesse, and whether they
determined to settle in that country or to goe forward. Presently
the Gouernour sent a Captaine with footmen and horsemen ouer
the riuer; and in their passage they were descried of the Indians,
and therefore he could take but tenne or twelue men and
women, with whom hee returned to the campe. This Riuer
which passed by Nilco, was that which passed by Cayas and
Autiamque, and fell into Rio grande, or the Great Riuer, which
passed by Pachaha and Aquixo neere vnto the prouince of
Guachoya: and the Lord thereof came vp the Riuer in canoes
to make warre with him of Nilco. On his behalf there came an
Indian to the Gouernour and said vnto him, That he was his
seruant, and prayed him so to hold him, and that within two
daies hee would come to kisse his Lordships hands: and at the
time appointed he came with some of his principal Indians,
which accompanied him, and with words of great offers and
courtesie hee gaue the Gouernour a present of many mantles
and Deeres skinnes. The Gouernour gaue him some other
things in recompense, and honoured him much. Hee asked
him what townes there were downe the Riuer? He answered
that he knew none other but his owne: and on the other side of
the Riuer a prouince of a Cacique called Quigalta. So hee
tooke his leaue of the Gouernour and went to his owne towne.
Within few daies the Gouernour determined to goe to Guachoya,
to learne there whether the Sea were neere, or whether there
were any habitation neere, where hee might relieue his companie,
while the brigantines were making, which he meant to send to
the land of the Christians. As he passed the Riuer of Nilco,
there came in canoes Indians of Guachoya vp the streame, and
when they saw him, supposing that he came to seeke them to
doe them some hurt, they returned downe the Riuer, and
informed the Cacique thereof: who with all his people, spoiling
the towne of all that they could carrie away, passed that night
ouer to the other side of Rio grande, or the Great Riuer. The
<span class="sidenote">Foure names of Rio grande.</span>
Gouernour sent a Captaine with fiftie men in sixe canoes
downe the Riuer, and went himselfe by land with the rest: hee came to
Guachoya vpon Sunday the 17. of April: he lodged in the towne of the
Cacique, which was inclosed about, and seated a crossebow shot distant
from the Riuer. Here the Riuer is called Tamaliseu, and in Nilco Tapatu,
and in Co&ccedil;a Mico, and in the port or mouth Ri.</p>

<div class="c4">Chap. XXIX.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Of the message which the Gouernour sent to Quigalta, and of
the answere which he returned; and of the things which
happened in this time.</div>

<p>As soone as the Gouernour come to Guachoya, hee sent Iohn
Danusco with as many men as could goe in the canoes vp the
Riuer. For when they came downe from Nilco, they saw on the
other side the Riuer new cabins made. Iohn Danusco went
and brought the canoes loden with Maiz, French beanes, Prunes,
and many loaues made of the substance of prunes. That day
came an Indian to the Gouernour from the Cacique of Guachoya,
and said, that his Lord would come the next day. The next day
they saw many canoes come vp the Riuer, and on the other side
of the great Riuer, they assembled together in the space of an
houre: they consulted whether they should come or not; and at
length concluded to come, and crossed the Riuer. In them
came the Cacique of Guachoya, and brought with him manie
Indians with great store of Fish, Dogges, Deeres skinnes, and
Mantles: And assoone as they landed, they went to the lodging
of the Gouernour, and presented him their gifts, and the Cacique
vttered these words:</p>

<p>Mightie and excellent Lord, I beseech your Lordship to
pardon mee the errour which I committed in absenting my selfe,
and not tarrying in this towne to haue receiued and serued your
Lordship; since, to obtaine this opportunitie of time, was, and is
as much as a great victorie to me. But I feared that, which I
needed not to haue feared, and so did that which was not reason
to do; But as haste maketh waste, and I remoued without
deliberation; so, as soone as I thought on it, I determined not to
follow the opinion of the foolish, which is, to continue in their
errour; but to imitate the wise and discreet, in changing my
counsell, and so I came to see what your Lordship will command
me to doe, that I may serue you in all things that are in my
power.</p>

<p>The Gouernour receiued him with much ioy, and gaue him
thankes for his present and offer. He asked him, whether hee
had any notice of the Sea. Hee answered, no, nor of any townes
downe the Riuer on that side; saue that two leagues from thence
was one towne of a principall Indian a subiect of his; and on
<!--016.png-->
<span class="pagenum">19</span>
the other side of the Riuer, three daies iourney from thence
downe the Riuer, was the Prouince of Quigalta, which was the
greatest Lord that was in that Countrie. The Gouernour thought
that the Cacique lied vnto him, to rid him out of his owne townes,
and sent Iohn Danusco with eight horsemen downe the Riuer, to
see what habitation there was, and to informe himselfe, if there
were any notice of the Sea. Hee trauelled eight daies, and at
his returne hee said, that in all that time he was not able to go
aboue 14. or 15. leagues, because of the great creekes that came
out of the Riuer, and groues of canes, and thicke woods that were
along the banks of the Riuer, and that hee had found no habitation.
<span class="sidenote">The Gouernor falleth sick of thought.</span>
The Gouernour fell into great dumps to see how hard it
was to get to the Sea: and worse, because his men and horses
euery day diminished, being without succour to sustaine themselues
in the country: and with that thought he fell
sick. But before he tooke his bed hee sent an Indian
to the Cacique at Quigalta to tell him, that hee was
the Childe of the Sunne, and that all the way that hee
came all men obeyed and serued him, that he requested him to
accept of his friendship, and come vnto him; for he would be
very glad to see him; and in signe of loue and obedience to
bring something with him of that which in his countrie was most
esteemed. The Cacique answered by the same Indian:</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A most wittie and stout answere of the Cacique of
Quigalta.</span>
That whereas he said he was the Child of the Sunne, if he
would drie vp the Riuer he would beleeue him: and
touching the rest, that he was wont to visit none; but
rather that all those of whom he had notice did visit
him, serued, obeyed and paid him tributes willingly
or perforce: therefore if hee desired to see him, it
were best he should come thither: that if hee came in peace, he
would receiue him with speciall good will; and if in warre, in
like manner hee would attend him in the towne where he was,
and that for him or any other hee would not shrinke one foote
backe.</p>

<p>By that time the Indian returned with this answere, the Gouernour
had betaken himselfe to bed, being euill handled with feuers,
and was much agrieued, that he was not in case to passe presently
the Riuer and to seeke him, to see if he could abate that pride of
his, considering the Riuer went now very strongly in those parts;
for it was neere halfe a league broad, and 16. fathomes deep, and
very furious, and ranne with a great current; and on both sides
<!--017.png-->
<span class="pagenum">20</span>
there were many Indians, and his power was not now so great,
but that hee had need to helpe himselfe rather by slights then
by force. The Indians of Guachoya came euery day with fish in
such numbers, that the towne was full of them. The Cacique
said, that on a certaine night hee of Quigalta would come to giue
battell to the Gouernour. Which the Gouernour imagined that
he had deuised, to driue him out of his countrey, and commanded
him to bee put in hold: and that night and all the rest, there was
good watch kept. Hee asked him wherefore Quigalta came not?
He said that hee came, but that he saw him prepared, and therefore
durst not giue the attempt: and hee was earnest with him to
send his Captaines ouer the Riuer, and that he would aide him
with many men to set vpon Quigalta. The Gouernour told him
that assoone as he was recouered, himselfe would seeke him out.
And seeing how many Indians came daily to the towne, and
what store of people was in that countrie, fearing they should al
conspire together and plot some treason against him; and
because the towne had some open gaps which were not made
an end of inclosing, besides the gates which they went in and
out by: because the Indians should not thinke he feared them,
he let them all alone vnrepaired; and commanded the horsemen
to be appointed to them, and to the gates: and all night the
horsemen went the round; and two and two of euery squadron
rode about, and visited the skouts that were without the towne
in their standings by the passages, and the crossebowmen that
kept the canoes in the Riuer. And because the Indians should
stand in feare of him, hee determined to send a Captaine to
Nilco, for those of Guachoya had told him that it was inhabited;
that by vsing them cruelly, neither the one nor the other should
presume to assaile him; and hee sent Nunnez de Touar with
fifteene horsemen, and Iohn de Guzman Captaine of the footmen
with his companie, in canoes vp the Riuer. The Cacique of
Guachoya sent for many canoes and many warlike Indians to
goe with the Christians: and the Captaine of the Christians,
called Nunnez de Touar, went by land with his horsemen, and
two leagues before he came to Nilco hee staied for Iohn de
Guzman, and in that place they passed the Riuer by night: the
horsemen came first, and in the morning by breake of day in
sight of the towne they lighted upon a spie; which assoone as
he perceiued the Christians, crying out amaine fled to the towne
to giue warning. Nunnez de Touar and his companie made
<!--018.png-->
<span class="pagenum">21</span>
such speed, that before the Indians of the towne could fully
come out, they were vpon them: it was champion ground that
was inhabited, which was about a quarter of a league.
<span class="sidenote">Five or sixe thousand people in Nilco.</span>
There were about fiue or sixe thousand people in
the towne: and, as many people came out of the
houses, and fled from one house to another, and
many Indians came flocking together from all parts, there was
neuer a horseman that was not alone among many. The
Captaine had commanded that they should not spare the life of
any male. Their disorder was so great, that there was no Indian
that shot an arrow at any Christian. The shreekes of women
and children were so great, that they made the eares deafe of
those that followed them. There were slaine an hundred
Indians, little more or lesse: and many were wounded with
great wounds, whom they suffered to escape to strike a terror in
the rest that were not there. There were some so cruell and
butcherlike, that they killed old and young, and all that they
met, though they made no resistance: and those which presumed
of themselues for their valour, and were taken for such,
brake through the Indians, bearing downe many with their
stirrops and brests of their horses; and some they wounded with
their lances, and so let them goe: and when they saw any youth
or woman they tooke them, and deliuered them to the footmen.
"These mens sinnes by Gods permission lighted on their own
heads: who, because they would seeme valiant, became cruell;
shewing themselues extreme cowards in the sight of all men,
when as most neede of valour was required, and,
afterward<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> they came to a shameful death."
Of the
Indians of Nilco were taken prisoners, fourescore women and
children, and much spoile. The Indians of Guachoya kept
back before they came at the towne, and staied without, beholding
the successe of the Christians with the men of Nilco. And
when they saw them put to flight, and the horsemen busie in
killing of them, they hastened to the houses to rob, and filled
their canoes with the spoile of the goods; and returned to
Guachoya before the Christians; and wondring much at the
sharpe dealing which they had seene them vse toward the
Indians of Nilco, they told their Cacique all that had passed
with great astonishment.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Of the death of the Adelantado Fernando de Soto: And how
Aluarado was elected Gouernour in his stead.</div>

<p>The Gouernour felt in himselfe that the houre approched,
wherein hee was to leaue this present life, and called for the
Kings officers, Captaines and principall persons, to whom he
made a speech, saying:</p>

<p>That now he was to goe to giue an account before the presence
of God of all his life past: and since it pleased him to take him
in such a time, and that the time was come that he knew his
death, that he his most vnworthie seruant did yeeld him many
thankes therefore; and desired all that were present and absent
(whom he confessed himselfe to be much beholding vnto for
their singular vertues, loue and loyaltie, which himselfe had well
tried in the trauels, which they had suffered, which alwaies in his
mind he did hope to satisfie and reward, when it should please
God to giue him rest, with more prosperitie of his estate,) that
they would pray to God for him, that for his mercie he would
forgiue him his sinnes, and receiue his soule into eternall glorie:
and that they would quit and free him of the charge which
hee had ouer them, and ought vnto them all, and that they
would pardon him for some wrongs which they might haue
receiued of him: And to auoid some diuision, which vpon his
death might fall out vpon the choice of his successour, he requested
them to elect a principall person, and able to gouerne,
of whom all should like well; and when he was elected, they
should sweare before him to obey him: and that he would
thanke them very much in so doing; because the griefe that he
had, would somewhat be asswaged, and the paine that he felt,
because he left them in so great confusion, to wit, in leauing
them in a strange Countrie, where they knew not where they were.</p>

<p>Baltasar de Gallegos answered in the name of all the rest:
And first of all comforting him, he set before his eies how short
the life of this world was, and with how many troubles and
miseries it is accompanied, and how God shewed him a singular
fauor which soonest left it: telling him many other things fit for
such a time. And for the last point, that since it pleased God
to take him to himselfe, although his death did justly grieue
<!--020.png-->
<span class="pagenum">23</span>
them much, yet as wel he, as al the rest, ought of necessitie to
conforme themselues to the will of God. And touching the
Gouernour which he commanded they should elect, he besought
him, that it would please his Lordship to name him which he
thought fit, and him they would obey. And presently he named
Luys de Moscoso de Aluarado his Captaine generall. And presently
he was sworne by all that were present and
elected for Gouernour.
<span class="sidenote">The death of Don Ferdinando de Soto the 21. of
May, 1542 at Guacoya.</span>
The next day, being the 21.
of May, 1542. departed out of this life, the valorous,
virtuous, and valiant Captaine, Don Fernando de
Soto, Gouernour of Cuba, and Adelantado of Florida:
whom fortune aduanced, as it vseth to doe others,
that hee might haue the higher fal. He departed in
such a place, and at such time, as in his sicknesse he had but
little comfort; and the danger wherein all his people were of
perishing in that Countrie, which appeared before their eies, was
cause sufficient, why euery one of them had need of comfort, and
why they did not visit nor accompanie him as they ought to
haue done. Luys de Moscoso determined to conceale his death
from the Indians, because Ferdinando de Soto had made them
beleeue, That the Christians were immortall; and also because
they tooke him to be hardie, wise, and valiant: and if they
should know that he was dead, they would bee bold to set vpon
the Christians, though they liued peaceablie by them.
<span class="sidenote">A wittie stratagem.</span>
In regard
of their disposition, and because they were nothing constant,
and beleeued all that was tolde them, the Adelantado made
them beleeue, that he knew some things that passed in secret
among themselues, without their knowledge, how, or in what
manner he came by them: and that the figure which
appeared in a glasse, which he shewed them, did tell
him whatsoeuer they practised and went about: and therefore
neither in word nor deed durst they attempt any thing that
might bee preiudiciall vnto him.</p>

<p>Assoone as he was dead, Luis de Moscoso commanded to
put him secretly in an house, where hee remained three daies:
and remoouing him from thence, commanded him to bee buried
in the night at one of the gates of the towne within the wall.
And as the Indians had seene him sick, and missed him, so did
they suspect what might bee. And passing by the place where
hee was buried, seeing the earth mooued, they looked and spake
one to another. Luys de Moscoso vnderstanding of it, commanded
<!--021.png-->
<span class="pagenum">24</span>
him to be taken vp, by night, and to cast a great deale
of sand into the mantles, wherein he was winded vp, wherein hee
was carried in a canoe, and throwne into the middest of the
Riuer. The Cacique of Guachoya inquired for him, demanding
what was become of his brother and Lord, the Gouernour: Luys
de Moscoso told him, that hee was gon to heauen, as many other
times hee did: and because hee was to stay there certaine daies
hee had left him in his place.
The Cacique thought with
himselfe that he was dead; and commanded two young and well
proportioned Indians to be brought thither;
<span class="sidenote">This is also the costome of the old
Tartars.</span>
and
said, that the vse of that Countrie was, when any Lord
died, to kill Indians to wait vpon him, and serue him
by the way: and for that purpose by his commandement
were those come thither: and prayed Luys de Moscoso to
command them to be beheaded, that they might attend and serue
his Lord and brother. Luys de Moscoso told him, that the
Gouernour was not dead, but gone to heauen, and that of his
owne Christian souldiers, he had taken such as he needed, to
serue him, and praied him to command those Indians to be loosed
and not to vse any such bad custome from thencefoorth: straightway
hee commanded them to be loosed, and to get them home to
their houses. And one of them would not goe; saying, that hee would
not serue him, that without desert had judged him to death, but that
hee would serue him as long as hee liued, which had saued his life.
<span class="sidenote">Seven hundred hogges.</span>
Luys de Moscoso caused all the goods of the Gouernor to be
sold at an outcrie: to wit, two men slaues, and two women slaues,
and three horses, and 700. hogges. For euery slaue
or horse, they gaue two or three thousand ducats:
which were to be paied at the first melting of gold or siluer, or at
the diuision of their portion of inheritance. And they entered
into bonds, though in the Countrie there was not wherewith, to
pay it within a yeere after, and put in sureties for the same.
Such as in Spaine had no goods to bind, gaue two hundred
ducats for an hog, giuing assurance after the same maner. Those
which had any goods in Spaine, bought with more feare, and
bought the lesse. From that time forward, most of the companie
had swine, and brought them vp, and fed vpon them; and
obserued Fridaies and Saturdaies, and the euenings of feasts,
which before they did not. For sometimes in two or three
moneths they did eate no flesh, and whensoeuer they could
come by it, they did eate it.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How the Gouernour Luys de Moscoso departed from Guachoya,
and went to Chaguate; and thence to Aguacay.</div>

<p>Some were glad of the death of Don Ferdinando de Soto,
holding for certaine, that Luys de Moscoso (which was giuen to
his ease) would rather desire to be among the Christians at rest,
then to continue the labours of the warre in subduing and discouering
of Countries; whereof they were alreadie wearie,
seeing the small profit that insued thereof. The Gouernour
commanded the Captaines and principall persons to meet to
consult and determine what they should doe. And being informed
what peopled habitation was round about, he vnderstood
that to the West, the Countrie was most inhabited, and that
downe the Riuer beyond Quigalta was vninhabited, and had little
store of food.
He desired them all, that euerie one would giue
his opinion in writing, and set his hand to it: that they might
resolue by generall consent, whether they should goe downe the
Riuer, or enter into the maine land.
<span class="sidenote">Their general resolution to trauell by land
Westward.</span>
All were of
opinion, that it was best to go by land toward the
West, because Nueua Espanna was that way: holding
the voyage by sea more dangerous, and of
greater hazard, because they could make no ship of
any strength to abide a storme, neither had they
Master, nor Pilot, Compasse, nor Chart, neither knew they how
farre the sea was off, nor had any notice of it: nor whether
the Riuer did make any great turning into the land, or
had any great fall the rocks, where all of them might be cast
away. And some which had seene the sea-chart, did find,
that from the place where they were by the sea coast to
Noua Espanna, might bee 400. leagues, little more or lesse; and
said, that though they went somewhat about by land in seeking a
peopled Countrie, if some great wildernesse which they could not
passe did not hinder them, by spending that sommer in trauell,
finding prouision to passe the winter in some peopled Countrie,
that the next summer after they might come to some Christian
land, and that it might fortune in their trauel by land to find
some rich Countrie, where they might doe themselves good. The
Gouernour, although he desired to get out of Florida in shorter
time, seeing the inconueniences they laid before him in trauelling

<span class="pagenum">26</span>
by sea, determined to follow that which seemed good to them all.
On Monday the fifth of Iune, he departed from Guachoya. The
Cacique gaue him a guide to Chaguate, and staied at home in
his owne towne. They passed through a prouince called Catalte:
and hauing passed a wildernesse of sixe daies iournie, the
twentieth day of the moneth he came to Chaguate. The Cacique
of this Prouince had visited the Gouernour Don Ferdinando de
Soto at Autiamque, whither he brought him presents of skinnes,
and mantles and salt. And a day before Luys de Moscoso came
to his towne, we lost a Christian that was sicke; which hee
suspected that the Indians had slaine. Hee sent the Cacique
word, that he should command his people to seeke him vp, and
send him vnto him, and that he would hold him, as he did, for
his friend: and if he did not, that neither he, nor his, should
escape his hands, and that hee would set his Countrie on fire.
Presently the Cacique came vnto him, and brought a great
present of mantles and skinnes, and the Christian that was lost,
and made this speech following:</p>

<p>Right excellent Lord, I would not deserue that conceit which
you had of me, for all the treasure of the world. What inforced
me to goe to visit and serue the excellent Lord Gouernour your
father in Autiamque, which you should haue remembred, where
I offered my selfe with all loyaltie, faith and loue, during my life
to serue and obey him? What then could be the cause, I hauing
receiued fauours of him, and neither you nor he hauing done
me any wrong, that should mooue me to doe the thing, which
I ought not? Beleeue this of mee, that neither wrong, nor
any worldly interest, was able to make me to haue done it,
nor shall be able to blind me. But as in this life it is a naturall
course, that after one pleasure, many sorrowes doe follow:
so by your indignation, fortune would moderate the ioy,
which my heart conceiueth with your presence; and that I should
erre, where I thought surest to haue hit the marke; in harboring
this Christian which was lost, and vsing him in such manner, as
he may tell himselfe, thinking that herin I did you service, with
purpose to deliuer him vnto you in Chaguate, and to serue you
to the vttermost of my power. If I deserue punishment for this,
I will receiue it at your hands, as from my Lord, as if it were a
fauour. For the loue which I did beare to the excellent
Gouernour, and which I beare to you hath no limit. And like
as you giue me chastisement, so will you also shew me fauour.
<!--024.png-->
<span class="pagenum">27</span>
And that which now I craue of you is this, to declare your will
vnto me, and those things, wherein I may bee able to doe you
the most and best seruice.</p>

<p>The Gouernour answered him, that because he did not find
him in that towne, hee was incensed against him, thinking he
had absented himselfe, as others had done: But seeing he now
knew his loyaltie and loue, he would alwaies hold him as a
brother, and fauour him in all his affaires. The Cacique went
with him to the towne where he resided, which was a daies
iournie from thence.
<span class="sidenote">Salt made of salt springs of water.</span>
They passed through a smal town, where
there was a lake, where the Indians made salt: and the Christians
made some one day while they rested there, of a
brackish water, which sprang neere the towne in
ponds like fountaines. The Gouernour staied in
Chaguate sixe daies. There he was informed of the habitation
that was toward the West. They told him, that three daies
iournie from thence was a Prouince called Aguacay. The day
that he departed from Chaguate, a Christian, called Francisco de
Guzman, the base sonne of a Gentleman of Siuill, staied behind,
and went to the Indians, with an Indian woman which he kept
as his concubine, for feare he should be punished for gaming
debts, that he did owe. The Gouernor had trauelled two daies
before he missed him; hee sent the Cacique word to seeke him
vp, and to send him to Aguacay, whither he trauelled: which hee
did not performe. From the Cacique of Aguacay, before they
came into the Countrie, there met him on the way 15. Indians
with a present of skinnes, fish and rosted venison. The Gouernour
came to his towne on Wednesday, the fourth of Iulie. He
found the towne without people, and lodged in it: he staied
there about a day; during which, he made some roades, and
tooke many men and women. There they had knowledge of the
South Sea. Here there was great store of salt made of sand,
which they gather in a vaine of ground like peeble stones. And
it was made as they make salt in Cayas.</p>

<div class="c4">Chap. XXXII.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How the Gouernour went from Aguacay to Naguatex,
and what happened vnto him.</div>

<p>The same day that the Gouernour departed from Aguacay he
<!--025.png-->
<span class="pagenum">28</span>
lodged in a small towne subiect to the Lord of that prouince.
The Campe pitched hard by a lake of salt water; and that euening
they made some salt there. The day following hee lodged
betweene two mountaines in a thinne groue of wood. The next
day hee came to a small towne called Pato. The fourth day
after his departure from Aguacay he came to the first habitation
of a prouince called Amaye. There an Indian was taken, which
said that from thence to Naguatex was a day and a halfes iourney:
which they trauelled, finding all the way inhabited places. Hauing
passed the peopled countrie of Amaye, on Saturday the 20. of
Iulie they pitched their Campe at noone betweene Amaye and
Naguatex along the corner of a groue of very faire trees. In the
same place certaine Indians were discouered, which came to view
them. The horsemen went out to them, and killed six, and
tooke two; whom the Gouernour asked, wherefore they came?
They said, to know what people hee had, and what order they
kept; and that the Cacique of Naguatex their Lord had sent
them, and that he, with other Caciques, which came to aide him,
determined that day to bid him battell. While they were
occupied in these questiones and answeres, there came many
Indians by two waies in two squadrons: and when they saw they
were descried, giuing a great crie they assaulted the Christians
each squadron by it selfe: but seeing what resistance the
Christians made them, they turned their backes and betooke
themselues to flight, in which many of them lost their liues: and
most of the horsemen following them in chase, carelesse of the
Camp, other two squadrons of Indians, which lay in ambush, set
vpon the Christians that were in the Campe, which also they
resisted, who also had their reward as the first. After the flight
of the Indians, and that the Christians were retired, they heard a
great noise a crossebow shot from the place where they were.
The Gouernour sent twelue horsemen to see what it was. They
found sixe Christians, foure footemen and two horsemen, among
many Indians; the horsemen defending the footemen with great
labour. These being of them that chased the first two squadrons,
had lost themselues, and comming to recouer the Campe fell
among those with whom they were fighting: and so they, and
those that came to succour them, slew many of the Indians, and
brought one aliue to the Campe: whom the Gouernour examined,
who they were that came to bid him battell. He told him, that
they were the Cacique of Naguatex, and of Amaye, and another
<!--026.png-->
<span class="pagenum">29</span>
of a prouince called Hacanac, a Lord of great Countries and
many subiects: and that the Cacique of Naguatex came for
Captaine and chiefest of them all. The Gouernour commanded
his right arme and nose to be cut off, and sent him to the Cacique
of Naguatex, charging him to tell him, that the next day hee would
be in his countrey to destroy him; and if hee would withstand his
entrance, hee should stay for him. That night he lodged there;
and the next day hee came to the habitation of Naguatex, which
was very scattering: he inquired where the Caciques chiefe
towne was? They told him that it was on the other side
of a Riuer, that passed thereby: hee trauelled thitherward,
and came vnto it: and on the other side he saw many
Indians, that taried for him, making shew as though they
would defend the passage. And because hee knew not
whether it could bee waded, nor where the passage was; and
that some Christians and horses were hurt; that they might
haue time to recouer, he determined to rest certaine daies in the
towne where he was. So hee pitched his campe a quarter of a
league from the Riuer, because the weather was very hot, neere
vnto the towne, in a thinne groue of very faire and hie trees
neere a brookes side: and in that place were certaine Indians
taken; whom hee examined, whether the Riuer were wadeable
or no? They said, yea, at some times, and in some places.
<span class="sidenote">August.</span>

<span class="sidenote">They passe the Riuer.</span>
Within ten daies after he sent two Captaines with
fifteene horsemen a peece vpward and downe the
Riuer with Indians to shew them where they should goe ouer, to
see what habitation was on the other side: And the Indians
withstood them both, defending the passage of the Riuer as farre
as they were able, but they passed in despite of them:
and on the other side of the Riuer they saw great
store of victuals; and with these newes returned to the Camp.</p>

<div class="c4">Chap. XXXIII.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How the Cacique of Naguatex came to visite the Gouernour:
and how the Gouernour departed from Naguatex and
came to Nondacao.</div>

<p>The Gouernour sent an Indian from Naguatex where hee lay,
to command the Cacique to come to serue and obey him, and
that hee would forgiue him all that was past; and if he came
not, that he would seeke him, and giue him such punishment as
he had deserued for that which he had done against him.
<!--027.png-->
<span class="pagenum">30</span>
Within two daies the Indian returned, and said that the Cacique
would come the next day: which, the same day when he came,
sent many Indians before him, among whom there were some
principall men: hee sent them to see what countenance they
found in the Gouernour, to resolue with himselfe whether hee
should goe or not. The Indians let him vnderstand, that he
was comming, and went away presently: and the Cacique came
within two houres accompanied with many of his men: they
came all in a ranke one before another on both sides, leauing a
lane in the middest where hee came.
<span class="sidenote">Tulla not far from Naguatex, Eastward.</span>
They came where the
Gouernour was, all of them weeping after the manner
of Tulla, which was not farre from thence toward
the East. The Cacique made his due obedience,
and this speech following:</p>

<p>Right high and mightie Lord, whom all the world ought to
serue and obey, I was bold to appeare before your Lordship,
hauing committed so heinous and abominable an act, as only for
me to haue imagined, deserued to be punished; trusting in your
greatnes, that although I deserue to obtaine no pardon, yet for
your owne sake only you will vse clemencie toward me, considering
how small I am in comparison of your Lordship; and
not to think vpon my weaknesses, which, to my griefe and for
my greater good, I haue knowne. And I beleeue that you and
yours are immortall; and that your Lordship is Lord of the land
of nature, seeing that you subdue all things, and they obey you,
euen the very hearts of men. For when I beheld the slaughter
and destruction of my men in the battell, which, through mine
ignorance, and the counsell of a brother of mine, which died in
the same, I gaue your Lordship, presently I repented me in my
heart of the error, which I had committed; and desired to serue
and obey you: and to this end I come, that your Lordship may
chastise and command mee as your owne.</p>

<p>The Gouernour answered him, that he forgaue him all which
was past, that from thenceforth hee should do his dutie, and that
he would hold him for his friend, and that he would fauour him
in all things.
<span class="sidenote">The Riuer growne vnpassable in August, at
Naguatex.</span>
Within foure daies hee departed thence,
and comming to the Riuer he could not passe, because
it was growne very bigge; which seemed to him a
thing of admiration, being at that time that it was,
and since it had not rained a moneth before. The
Indians said, that it increased many times after that manner
<!--028.png-->
<span class="pagenum">31</span>
without raining in all the countrie.
<span class="sidenote">Coniectures of a Sea to the Northward.</span>
It was supposed,
that it might be the tide that came into it. It was
learned that the flood came alway from aboue, and
that the Indians of all that countrie had no knowledge
of the Sea. The Gouernour returned vnto the place where he
had lodged before: and vnderstanding within eight daies after
that the Riuer was passable, he departed. He passed ouer and
found the towne without people: he lodged in the field, and sent
the Cacique word to come vnto him, and to bring him a guide
to goe forward. And some daies being past, seeing the Cacique
came not, nor sent any bodie, hee sent two Captaines sundrie
waies to burne the townes, and to take such Indians as they
could finde: They burnt great store of victuals, and took many
Indians. The Cacique seeing the hurt that he receiued in his
countrie, sent sixe principall Indians with three men for guides
which knew the language of the countrie, through which the
Gouernour was to passe. Hee departed presently from Naguatex,
and within three daies iourney came to a towne of foure or fiue
houses, which belonged to the Cacique of that prouince, which
is called Nissoone: it was euill inhabited and had little Maiz.
Two daies iourney forward the guides which guided the Gouernour,
if they were to goe Westward, guided him to the East;
and sometimes went vp and downe through very great woods
out of the way. The Gouernour commanded them to bee
hanged vpon a tree: and a woman that they tooke in Nissoone
guided him, and went backe againe to seeke the way. In two
daies he came to another miserable towne called Lacane: an
Indian was taken in that place, that said, that the countrie of
Nondacao was a countrie of great habitation, and the houses
scattering the one from the other, as they vse to bee in mountains,
and had great store of Maiz. The Cacique came with his
men weeping, like them of Naguatex: for this is their vse in
token of obedience: hee made him a present of much fish, and
offered to doe what he would command him. Hee tooke his
leaue, and gaue him a guide to the prouince of Soacatino.</p>

<div class="c4">Chap. XXXIV.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How the Gouernour went from Nondacao to Soacatino and
Guasco, and passed through a desert, from whence, for
want of a guide, and an interpretour, he returned to Nilco.</div>

<p>The Gouernour departed from Nondacao toward Soacatino,
<!--029.png-->
<span class="pagenum">32</span>
and in fiue daies iournie came to a Prouince called Aays. The
Indians which inhabited it, had no notice of the Christians: but
assoone as they saw that they entred into their country, they
assembled themselues: and as they came together 50. or 100.
they came foorth to fight: while some fought, others came and
charged our men another way, and while they followed some,
others followed them. The fight lasted the greatest part of the
day, till they came to their towne. Some horses and men were
wounded, but not to any hurt of their trauelling: for there was
no wound that was dangerous. There was a great spoile made
of the Indians. That day that the Gouernour departed from
thence, the Indian that guided him said, that in Nondacao he
had heard say, that the Indians of Soacatino had seene other
Christians, whereof they all were very glad: thinking it might be
true, and that they might haue entred into those parts by Nueua
Espanna; and that if it were so, it was in their owne hand to
goe out of Florida, if they found nothing of profit: for they feared
they should lose themselues in some wildernes. This Indian
led him two daies out of the way. The Gouernour commanded
to torture him. He said, that the Cacique of Nondacao, his
Lord, had commanded him to guide them so, because they were
his enemies, and that hee was to doe as his Lord commanded
him. The Gouernour commanded him to be cast to the dogs:
and another guided him to Soacatino, whither hee came the day
following. It was a verie poore Countrie: there was great want
of Maiz in that place. Hee asked the Indians, whether they
knew of any other Christians. They said, that a little from
thence toward the South they heard they were.
<span class="sidenote">20. daies trauell toward the South.</span>
He
trauelled 20. daies through a Countrie euill inhabited,
where they suffered great scarcitie and trouble. For
that little Maiz which the Indians had, they had
hidden and buried in the woods, where the Christians, after
they were well wearied with their trauell, at the end
of their iournie went to seeke by digging what they
should eat.
<span class="sidenote">Guasco: here they found some Turkie stones and
mantles of cotton wooll. <a href="#Chap_XXXV">Chap. 35.</a></span>
At last, comming to a Prouince that
was called Guasco, they found Maiz, wherewith they
loaded their horses, and the Indians that they had.
From thence they went to another towne called
Naquisco&ccedil;a. The Indians said, they had no notice of any other
Christians. The Gouernor commanded to torment them. They
said, that they came first to another Lordship, which was called
<!--030.png-->
<span class="pagenum">33</span>
Na&ccedil;acahoz, and from thence returned again to the West, from
whence they came. The Gouernour came in two daies to
Na&ccedil;acahoz: Some women were taken there: among whom there
was one, which said, that she had seene Christians, and had
been taken by them, and had run away. The Gouernour sent a
Captaine with 15. horsemen to the place where the women said
she had seene them, to see if there were any signe of horses, or
any token of their being there. After they had gone three or
foure leagues the woman that guided them said, that all that she
had told them was vntrue. And so they held all the rest that
the Indians had said, of seeing Christians in the land of Florida.
And, because the Countrie that way was poore of Maiz, and
toward the West, there was no notice of any habitation, they
returned to Guasco. The Indians told them there, that 10.
daies iournie from thence toward the West, was a Riuer called
Daycao; whither they went sometimes a hunting and killing of
Deere: and that they had seene people on the other side, but
knew not what habitation was there.
<span class="sidenote">The Riuer of Daycayo: which seemeth to be the Rio
del oro.</span>
There the Christians
tooke such Maiz as they found and could carrie,
and, going 10. daies iournie through a wildernesse,
they came to the Riuer which the Indians had told
them of. Ten horsemen, which the Gouernour
had sent before, passed ouer the same, and went in
a way that led to the Riuer, and lighted vpon a companie of
Indians that dwelt in verie little cabins: who, assoone as they
saw them, tooke themselues to flight, leauing that which they
had; all which was nothing but miserie and pouertie. The
Countrie was so poore, that among them all there was not found
halfe a peck of Maiz. The horsemen tooke two Indians, and
returned with them to the Riuer, where the Gouernour staied for
them. He sought to learne of them what habitation was toward
the West. There was none in the Camp that could vnderstand
their language. The Gouernour assembled the Captaines and
principall persons, to determine with their aduice what they
should doe. And the most part said, that they thought it best
to returne backe to Rio grande, or the Great Riuer of Guachoya;
because that in Nilco and thereabout was store of Maiz: saying,
that they would make pinaces that winter, and the next sommer
passe down the Riuer to seaward in them, and comming to the
Sea they would goe along the coast to Nueua Espanna. For
though it seemed a doubtfull thing and difficult, by that which
<!--031.png-->
<span class="pagenum">34</span>
they had already alleaged, yet it was the last remedie they had.
<span class="sidenote">No trauelling by land without an
interpretour.</span>
For by land they could not goe for want of an
Interpretour. And they held, that the countrie
beyond the Riuer of Daycao, where they were, was
that which Cabe&ccedil;a de Vaca mentioned in his relation
that he passed of the Indians, which liued like the Alarbes,
hauing no setled place, and fed vpon Tunas and rootes of the
fields, and wilde beasts that they killed. Which if it were so, if
they should enter into it and finde no victuals to passe the
winter, they could not chuse but perish. For they were entred
alreadie into the beginning of October: and if they staied any
longer, they were not able to returne for raine and snowes, nor
to sustaine themselues in so poore a countrey. The Gouernour
(that desired long to see himselfe in a place where hee might
sleepe his full sleep, rather then to conquer and gouerne a
countrie where so many troubles presented themselues) presently
returned back that same way that he came.</p>

<div class="c4"><a id="Chap_XXXV"></a>Chap. XXXV.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How they returned to Nilco, and came to Minoya, where they
agreed to make ships to depart out of the land of
Florida.</div>

<p>When that which was determined was published in the
Campe, there were many that were greatly grieued at it: for
they held the Sea voyage as doubtfull, for the euill meanes they
had, and of as great danger, as the trauelling by land: and they
hoped to finde some rich countrie before they came to the land
of the Christians, by that which Cabe&ccedil;a de Vaca had told the
Emperour: and that was this;
<span class="sidenote">Gold, siluer, and precious stones in
Florida.</span>
That after hee had
found clothes made of cotton wooll, hee saw gold
and siluer, and stones of great value. And they had
not yet come where hee had been. For vntill that
place hee alwaies trauelled by the Sea coast: and they trauelled
farre within the land; and that going toward the West, of
necessitie they should come where hee had been. For he said,
That in a certain place he trauelled many daies, and entred into
<!--032.png-->
<span class="pagenum">35</span>
the land toward the North.
<span class="sidenote">Turkie stones and mantles of cotton wooll found in
Guasco.</span>
And in Guasco they
had alreadie found some Turkie stones, and mantles
of cotton wooll: which the Indians signified by signes
that they had from the West: and that holding that
course they should draw neere to the land of the
Christians. But though they were much discontented with it,
and it grieued many to goe backward, which would rather haue
aduentured their liues and haue died in the land of Florida, then
to haue gone poore out of it: yet were they not a sufficient part
to hinder that which was determined, because the principall men
agreed with the Gouernour. And afterward there was one that
said, hee would put out one of his owne eyes, to put out another
of Luis de Moscoso; because it would grieue him much to see
him prosper: because aswell himself as others of his friends had
crossed that which he durst not haue done, seeing that within
two daies hee should leaue the gouernment.
<span class="sidenote">150. leagues betweene the Riuer of Daycao, and Rio
grande.</span>
From
Daycao, where now they were, to Rio grande, or the
Great Riuer, was 150. leagues: which vnto that
place they had gone Westward. And by the way as
they returned backe they had much adoe to find
Maiz to eate: for where they had passed, the countrey was
destroyed: and some little Maiz that was left the Indians had
hidden. The townes which in Naguatex they had burned
(whereof it repented them) were repaired againe, and the houses
full of Maiz.
<span class="sidenote">Fine earthen vessels.</span>
This countrie is well inhabited and
plentifull. In that place are vessels made of clay,
which differ very little from those of Estremoz, or
Monte-mor. In Chaguate the Indians by commandement of the
Cacique came peaceably, and said, that the Christian which
remained there would not come. The Gouernour wrote vnto
him, and sent him inke and paper that he might answere. The
substance of the words of the letter was to declare vnto him his
determination, which was, to goe out of the land of Florida, and
to put him in remembrance that he was a Christian, that hee
would not remaine in the subiection of Infidels, that he pardoned
him the fault which he had done in going away to the Indians,
that hee should come vnto him: and if they did stay him, that
hee would aduertise him thereof by writing. The Indian went
with the letters and came again without any more answere, then,
on the back side, his name and his seale, that they might know
he was aliue. The Gouernour sent twelue horsemen to seeke
<!--033.png-->
<span class="pagenum">36</span>
him: but he, which had his spies, so hid himselfe, that they
could not find him. For want of Maiz the Gouernour could not
stay any longer to seeke him. Hee departed from Chaguate,
and passed the Riuer by Aays; going downe by it hee found a
towne called Chilano, which as yet they had not seen. They
came to Nilco, and found so little Maiz, as could not suffice till
they made their ships; because the Christians, being in Guachoya
in the seede time, the Indians for feare of them durst not come
to sow the grounds of Nilco: and they knew not thereabout any
other countrie where any Maiz was: and that was the most
fruitfull soile that was thereaway, and where they had most hope
to finde it. Euery one was confounded, and the most part
thought it bad counsell to come backe from the Riuer of Dacayo,
and not to haue followed their fortune, going that way that went
ouer land. For by Sea it seemed impossible to saue themselues,
vnlesse God would worke a miracle for them: for there was
neither Pilot, nor Sea-chart, neither did they know where the
Riuer entred into the Sea, neither had they notice of it, neither
had they any thing wherewith to make sailes, nor any store of
Enequem, which is a grasse whereof they make Okam, which
grew there: and that which they found they saued to calke the
Pinaces withall, neither had they any thing to pitch them
withall: neither could they make ships of such substance, but
that any storme would put them in great danger: and they
feared much it would fall out with them, as it did with
Pamphilo de Naruaez, which was cast away vpon that coast:
And aboue all it troubled them most, that they could find no
Maiz: for without it they could not bee sustained, nor could
doe any thing that they had neede of. All of them were put
to great confusion. Their chiefe remedy was to commit themselues
to God, and to beseech him that he would direct them
the way that they might saue their liues. And it pleased him of
his goodnesse, that the Indians of Nilco came peaceablie, and
told them, that two daies iourney from thence, neere vnto the
Great Riuer, were two townes, whereof the Christians had no
notice, and that the prouince was called Minoya, and was a
fruitfull soile: that, whether at this present there was any Maiz
or no, they knew not, because they had warre with them: but
that they would be very glad with the fauour of the Christians to
goe and spoyle them. The Gouernour sent a Captaine thither
with horsemen and footmen, and the Indians of Nilco with him.
<!--034.png-->
<span class="pagenum">37</span>
Hee came to Minoya, and found two great townes seated in a
plaine and open soile, halfe a league distant, one in sight of
another, and in them hee tooke many Indians, and found great
store of Maiz. Presently he lodged in one of them, and sent
word to the Gouernour what hee had found: wherewith they
were all exceeding glad. They departed from Nilco in the
beginning of December; and all that way, and before from
Chilano, they endured much trouble: for they passed through
many waters, and many times it rained with a Northren winde,
and was exceeding cold, so that they were in the open field with
water ouer and vnderneath them: and when at the end of their
daies iourney they found drie ground to rest vpon, they gaue
great thanks to God. With this trouble almost all the Indians
that serued them died. And after they were in Minoya, many
Christians also died: and the most part were sicke of great and
dangerous diseases, which had a spice of the lethargie. At this
place died Andrew de Vasconcelos, and two Portugals of Eluas,
which were very neere him: which were brethren, and by their
surname called Sotis. The Christians lodged in one of the
townes, which they liked best: which was fensed about, and
distant a quarter of a league from the Great Riuer. The Maiz
that was in the other towne was brought thither; and in all it was
esteemed to bee 6000. hanegs or bushels. And there was the
best timber to make ships, that they had seene in all the land of
Florida: wherefore all of them gaue God great thankes for so
singular a fauour, and hoped that that which they desired would
take effect, which was, that they might safely bee conducted into
the land of the Christians.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How there were seuen Brigandines builded, and how they
departed from Minoya.</div>

<p>Assoone as they came to Minoya, the Gouernor commanded
them to gather all the chaines together, which euerie one had to
lead Indians in; and to gather all the yron which they had for
their prouision, and al the rest that was in the Camp: and to set
vp a forge to make nailes, and commanded them to cut downe
timber for the brigandines. And a Portugall of Ceuta, who
hauing bin a prisoner in Fez, had learned to saw timber with a
<!--035.png-->
<span class="pagenum">38</span>
long saw, which for such purposes they had carried with them,
did teach others, which helped him to saw timber. And a
Genowis, whom it pleased God to preserue (for without him they
had neuer come out of the countrie: for there has neuer another
that could make ships but hee) with foure or fiue other Biscaine
carpenters, which hewed his plancks and other timbers, made
the brigandines: And two calkers, the one of Genua, the other
of Sardinia did calke them with the tow of an hearb like hempe,
whereof before I haue made mention, which there is named
Enequen. And because there was not enough of it, they calked
them with the flaxe of the Countrie, and with the mantles, which
they rauelled for that purpose. A cooper which they had among
them fell sicke, and was at the point of death: and there was
none other that had any skill in that trade: it pleased God to
send him his health: And albeit he was verie weake, and could
not labour; yet 15. daies before they departed, he made for
euery brigandine two halfe hogs heads, which the mariners call
quarterets, because foure of them hold a pipe of
water.
<span class="sidenote">Taguanate two daies iourney aboue Minoya.</span>
The Indians which dwelt two daies iournie
aboue the Riuer in a Prouince called Taguanate, and
likewise those of Nilco and Guacoya, and others
their neighbours seeing the brigandines in making,
thinking, because their places of refuge are in the water, that
they were to goe to seeke them: and because the Gouernour
demanded mantles of them, as necessarie for sailes, came many
times, and brought many mantles, and great store of fish. And
for certaine it seemed that God was willing to fauour them in so
great necessitie, moouing the minds of the Indians to bring
them: for to goe to take them, they were neuer able. For in
the towne where they were, assoone as winter came in, they were
so inclosed and compassed with water, that they could go no
farther by land, then a league, and a league and an half.
<span class="sidenote">The great vse of horses.</span>
And
if they would go farther, they could carrie no horses,
and without them they were not able to fight with
the Indians, because they were many: and so many
for so many (numbers being equal) on foote they had the aduantage of them by water
and by land, because they were more apt and lighter, and by
reason of the disposition of the Countrie, which was according
to their desire for the vse of their warre. They brought also
some cords, and those which wanted for cables were made of the
<!--036.png-->
<span class="pagenum">39</span>
barkes of Mulberrie trees. They made stirrops of wood, and
made ankers of their stirrops.
<span class="sidenote">The mightie increasing of the Riuer for two
moneths space, to wit, all March and April.</span>
In the moneth of
March, when it had not rained a moneth before, the
Riuer grew so big, that it came to Nilco, which was
nine leagues off: and on the other side, the Indians
said, that it reached other nine leagues into the
land. In the towne where the Christians were,
which was somewhat high ground, where they could
best goe, the water reached to the stirrops. They made certaine
rafts of timber, and laid manie boughes vpon them, wheron they
set their horses, and in the houses they did the like. But seeing
that nothing preuailed, they went vp to the lofts: and if they
went out of the houses, it was in canoes, or on horseback in
those places where the ground was hiest. So they were two
moneths, and could doe nothing, during which time the Riuer
decreased not. The Indians ceased not to come vnto the
brigantines as they were wont, and came in canoes. At that
time the Gouernour feared they would set vpon him. Hee
commanded his men to take an Indian secretly of those that
came to the towne, and to stay him till the rest were gone: and
they tooke one. The Gouernour commanded him to bee put to
torture, to make him confesse, whether the Indians
did practise any treason or no.
<span class="sidenote">The grand conspiracie of the Indians against the
Christians.</span>
Hee confessed that
the Caciques of Nilco, Guachoya, and Taguanate,
and others, which in al were about 20. Caciques,
with a great number of people, determined to come
vpon him; and that three daies before, they would send a great
present of fish to colour their great treason and malice, and on
the verie day they would send some Indians before
with another present.
<span class="sidenote">Note well.</span>
And these with those which
were our slaues, which were of their conspiracie also, should set
the houses on fire, and first of all possesse themselues of the
lances which stood at the doores of the houses; and the Caciques
with all their men should bee neere the towne in ambush in the
wood, and when they saw the fire kindled, should come, and
make an end of the conquest. The Gouernour commanded the
Indian to be kept in a chaine, and the selfesame day
that he spake of there came 30. Indians with fish.
<span class="sidenote">Thirtie Indians of the Cacique of Guachoya haue
their right hands cut off.</span>
He commanded their right hands to be cut off, and
sent them so backe to the Cacique of Guachoya,
whose men they were. He sent him word, that he
<!--037.png-->
<span class="pagenum">40</span>
and the rest should come when they would, for he
desired nothing more, and that hee should know, that they
thought not any thing which he knew not before they thought of
it. Hereupon they all were put in a very great feare: And the
Caciques of Nilco and Taguanate came to excuse themselues:
and a few daies after came he of Guachoya, and a principall
Indian and his subiect, said, he knew by certaine information,
That the Caciques of Nilco and Taguanate were agreed to come
and make warre vpon the Christians. Assoone as the Indians
came from Nilco, the Gouernour examined them, and they confessed
it was true. Hee deliuered them presently to the principall
man of Guachoya, which drew them out of the towne and killed
them. Another day came some from Taguanate, and confessed
it likewise.
<span class="sidenote">The right hands and noses of traitours cut
off.</span>
The Gouernour commanded their
right hands and noses to be cut off, and sent them to
the Cacique, wherewith they of Guachoya remained
very well contented: and they came oftentimes with
presents of mantles and fish, and hogs, which bred
in the Countrie of some swine that were lost by the way the
last yeere. Assoone as the waters were slaked, they perswaded
the Gouernour to send men to Taguanate: They came
and brought canoes, wherein the footemen were conueied
downe the Riuer, and a Captaine with horsemen went by
land; and the Indians of Guachoya, which guided him, till
they came to Taguanate, assaulted the towne, and tooke many
men and women, and mantles, which with those that they
had alreadie were sufficient to supplie their want.
<span class="sidenote">The Riuer increaseth but once a yeere when the
snowes doe melt in March and Aprill.</span>
The brigandines being finished in the moneth of Iune, the Indians
hauing told vs, That the Riuer increased but once a
yeere, when the snowes did melt, in the time wherein
I mentioned it had alreadie increased, being now in
sommer, and hauing not rained a long time, it
pleased God, that the flood came vp to the towne to
seeke the brigandines, from whence they carried them
by water to the Riuer.
<span class="sidenote">A miraculous accident.</span>
Which, if they had gone by
land, had been in danger of breaking and splitting
their keeles, and to bee all vndone; because that for
want of iron, the spikes were short, and the planckes and timber
very weake. The Indians of Minoya, during the time that they
were there, came to serue them (being driuen thereunto by
necessity) that of the Maiz which they had taken from them
<!--038.png-->
<span class="pagenum">41</span>
they would bestow some crummes vpon them. And because the
Countrie was fertill, and the people vsed to feed of Maiz, and
the Christians had gotten all from them that they had, and the
people were many, they were not able to sustaine themselues.
Those which came to the towne were so weake and feeble, that
they had no flesh left on their bones: and many came and died
neere the towne for pure hunger and weaknesse. The Gouernour
commanded vpon grieuous punishments to giue them no
Maiz. Yet, when they saw that the hogges wanted it not, and
that they had yeelded themselues to serue them, and considering
their miserie and wretchednes, hauing pity of them, they gaue
them part of the Maiz which they had. And when the time of
their embarkment came, there was not sufficient to serue their
own turnes. That which there was, they put into the brigandines,
and into great canoes tied two and two together. They shipped
22. of the best horses, that were in the Camp, the rest they made
dried flesh of; and dressed the hogges which they had in like
manner. They departed from Minoya the second day of
Iulie, 1543.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">As the Christians went downe the great Riuer on their voyage,
the Indians of Quigalta did set vpon them, and what was
the successe thereof.</div>

<p>The day before they departed from Minoya, they determined
to dismisse al the men and women of the Countrie, which they
had detained as slaues to serue them, saue some hundred, little
more or lesse, which the Gouernour embarked, and others
whom it pleased him to permit. And because there were
many men of qualitie, whom he could not deny that which
he granted to others, he vsed a policy, saying, that they
might serue them as long as they were in the Riuer, but when
they came to the sea, they must send them away for want of
water, because they had but few vessels. He told his friends in
secret, that they should carrie theirs to Nueua Espanna: And
all those whom hee bare no good will vnto (which were the
greater number) ignorant of that which was hidden from them,
which afterward time discouered, thinking it inhumanitie for so
little time of seruice, in reward of the great seruice that they
<!--039.png-->
<span class="pagenum">42</span>
had done them, to carrie them with them,
<span class="sidenote">500. Slaues left in the Countrie.</span>
to leaue them slaues
to other men out of their owne Countries; left fiue
hundred men and women: among whom were
many boies and girles, which spake and vnderstood
the Spanish tongue. The most of them did nothing but weepe:
which mooued great compassion; seeing that all of them with
good will would haue become Christians, and were left in state
of perdition.
<span class="sidenote">They sailed down Rio Grande from Minoya 17. daies
before they came to the mouth thereof.</span>
There went from Minoya 322. Spaniards
in seuen brigandines, well made, saue that the plankes
were thin, because the nailes were short, and were
not pitched, nor had any decks to keep the water
from comming in. In stead of decks they laid planks,
whereon the mariners might runne to trim their sailes,
and the people might refresh themselues aboue and
below: The Gouernour made his Captaines, and gaue to euery
one his brigandine, and took their oth and their word, that they
would obey him, vntill they came to the land of the Christians.
The Gouernour tooke one of the brigandines for himself, which
he best liked. The same day that they departed from Minoya,
they passed by Guachoya, where the Indians tarried for them in
canoes by the Riuer. And on the shore, they had made a great
arbour with boughes: They desired him to come on shore; but
he excused himselfe, and so went along: The Indians in their
canoes accompanied him; and comming where an arme of the
Riuer diclined on the right hand, they said, that the Prouince of
Quigalta was neere vnto that place, and importuned the Gouernour
to set vpon him, and that they would aide him. And because
they had said, that he dwelt three daies journie down the Riuer,
the Gouernour supposed that they had plotted some treason
against him, and there left them; and went downe with the
greatest force of the water. The current was very strong, and
with the helpe of ores, they went very swiftly. The first day
they landed in a wood on the left hand of the Riuer, and at
night they withdrew themselues to the brigandines.
<span class="sidenote">The second day.</span>
The next
day they came to a towne, where they went on shore,
and the people that was in it durst not tarrie. A
woman that they tooke there being examined, said, that that
towne belonged to a Cacique named Huasene, subiect to Quigalta,
and that Quigalta tarried for them below in the Riuer with
many men. Certaine horsemen went thither, and found some
houses, wherein was much Maiz. Immediately more of them
<!--040.png-->
<span class="pagenum">43</span>
went thither and tarried there one day,
<span class="sidenote">Another day.</span>
in which they
did beate out, and tooke as much Maiz as they needed.
While they were there, many Indians came from the nether part
of the Riuer, and on the other side right against them somewhat
carelessely set themselues in order to fight. The Gouernour
sent in two canoes the crossebowmen that he had, and as many
more as could goe in them. They ran away, and seeing the
Spaniards could not ouertake them, they returned backe, and
tooke courage; and coming neerer, making an outcrie, they
threatned them: and assoone as they departed thence, they
went after them, some in canoes, and some by land along the
Riuer; and getting before, comming to a towne that stood by
the Riuers side, they ioyned al together, making a shew that
they would tarrie there. Euerie brigandine towed a canoe
fastened to their sternes for their particular seruice.
<span class="sidenote">A town burned.</span>
Presently there entred men into euerie one of them,
which made the Indians to flie, and burned the
town. The same day they presently landed in a
great field, where the Indians durst not tarrie.
<span class="sidenote">The third day. A fleet of an hundred faire and
great canoes.</span>
The
next day there were gathered together an hundred
canoes, among which were some that carried 60. and
70. men, and the principall mens canoes had their tilts, and
plumes of white and red feathers for their ensignes: and they
came within two crossebow shot of the brigandines, and sent
three Indians in a small canoe with a fained message to view
the manner of the brigandines, and what weapons they had.
And comming to the side of the Gouernours brigandine, one of
the Indians entred, and said:</p>

<p>That the Cacique of Quigalta his Lord, sent him his commendations,
and did let him vnderstand, that all the Indians of
Guachoya had told him concerning himselfe, was false, and that
they had incensed him, because they were his enemies; that he
was his seruant, and should find him so.</p>

<p>The Gouernour answered him, that he beleeued all that he
said was true, and willed him to tell him, that he esteemed his
friendship very much. With this answer they returned to the
place where the rest in their canoes were waiting for them, and
from thence all of them fell downe, and came neere the Spaniards,
shouting aloud, and threatning of them. The Gouernour sent
Iohn de Guzman, which had been a Captaine of footemen in
Florida, with 15. armed men in canoes to make them giue way.
<!--041.png-->
<span class="pagenum">44</span>
Assoone as the Indians saw them come towards them, they
diuided themselues into two parts, and stood still till the Spaniards
came nie them, and when they were come neere them, they
ioyned together on both sides, taking Iohn de Guzman in the
middest, and then they came first with him, and with great
furie borded them: And as their canoes were bigger, and many
of them leaped into the water to stay them, and to lay hold on
the canoes of the Spaniards, and ouerwhelme them; so presently
they ouerwhelmed them. The Christians fell into the water,
and with the weight of their armour sunke downe to the bottome:
and some few, that by swimming or holding by the canoe could
haue saued themselues, with oares and staues, which they had,
they strooke them on the head and made them sinke. When
they of the brigandines saw the ouerthrow, though they went
about to succour them, yet through the current of the Riuer they
could not goe backe. Foure Spaniards fled to the
brigandine that was neerest to the canoes; and only
these escaped of those that came among the Indians.
<span class="sidenote">Eleven Spaniards drowned.</span>
They were eleuen that died there: among whom Iohn de Guzman
was one, and a sonne of Don Carlos, called Iohn de Vargas:
the rest also were persons of account and men of great
courage. Those that escaped by swimming, said that they saw
the Indians enter the canoe of John de Guzman at the sterne of
one of their canoes, and whether they carried him away dead or
aliue they could not certainly tell.</p>

<div class="c4">Chap. XXXVIII.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Which declareth how they were pursued by the
Indians.</div>

<p>The Indians, seeing that they had gotten the victorie, tooke
such courage, that they assaulted them in the brigandines, which
they durst not doe before.
<span class="sidenote">25. Spaniards wounded.</span>
They came first to that brigandine
wherein Calderon went for Captaine, and was in the rereward:
and at the first volie of arrowes they wounded 25.
men. There were only foure armed men in this
brigandine: these did stand at the brigandines side
to defend it. Those that were vnarmed, seeing how they hurt
them, left their oares and went vnder the deck: whereupon the
brigandine began to crosse, and to goe where the current of the
<!--042.png-->
<span class="pagenum">45</span>
streame carried it. One of the armed men seeing this, without
the commandement of the Captaine, made a footman to take an
oare and stirre the brigandine, hee standing before
him and defending him with his target.
<span class="sidenote">The great vse of large targets.</span>
The Indians
came no neerer then a bowshot, from whence they
offended and were not offended, receiuing no hurt: for in euery
brigandine was but one crossebow, and those which wee had
were very much out of order. So that the Christians did nothing
else but stand for a butte to receiue their arrowes. Hauing left
this brigandine they went to another, and fought with it halfe an
houre; and so from one to another they fought with
them all.
<span class="sidenote">Strong mats a good defence against arrowes.</span>
The Christians had mattes to lay vnder
them, which were double, and so close and strong,
that no arrow went thorow them. And assoone as
the Indians gaue them leisure, they fensed the
brigandines with them. And the Indians seeing that they could
not shoote leuell, shot their arrowes at random vp into the aire,
which fell into the brigandines, and hurt some of the men: and
not therewith contented, they sought to get to them which were
in the canoes with the horses. Those of the brigandines
enuironed them to defend them, and tooke them among them.
Thus seeing themselues much vexed by them, and so wearied
that they could no longer endure it, they determined to trauell
all the night following, thinking to get beyond the countrie of
Quigalta, and that they would leaue them: but when they thought
least of it, supposing they had now left them, they heard very
neere them so great outcries, that they made them deafe, and so
they followed vs all that night, and the next day till noone, by
which time we were come into the countrie of others, whom
they desired to vse vs after the same manner; and so they did.
The men of Quigalta returned home; and the other in fiftie
canoes fought with vs a whole day and a night: and they entred
one of the brigandines, that came in the rereward by the canoe
which she had at her sterne, and tooke away a woman which they
found in it, and afterward hurt some of the men of the brigandines.
Those which came with the horses in the canoes, being
wearie with rowing night and day, lingered behind; and presently
the Indians came vpon them, and they of the brigandines tarried
for them. The Gouernour resolued to goe on shore and to kill
the horses, because of the slow way which they made because
of them. Assoone as they saw a place conuenient for it, they
<!--043.png--><span class="pagenum">46</span>
<span class="sidenote">Dried horseflesh for food.</span>
went thither and killed the horses, and brought the
flesh of them to drie it aboord. Foure or fiue of them
remained on shore aliue: The Indians went vnto them,
after the Spaniards were embarked. The horses were not acquainted
with them, and began to neigh, and runne vp and downe, in such
sort, that the Indians, for feare of them, leaped into the water: and
getting into their canoes went after the brigandines, shooting cruelly
at them. They followed vs that euening and the night following
till the next day at tenne of the clocke, and then returned vp the
Riuer. Presently from a small towne that stood vpon the Riuer
came seuen canoes, and followed vs a little way downe the Riuer,
shooting at vs: but seeing they were so few that they could do
vs but little harme, they returned to their towne. From thence
forward, vntill they came to the Sea, they had no encounter.
They sailed downe the Riuer seuenteene daies, which may be
two hundred and fifty leagues iourney, little more or lesse: and
neere vnto the Sea the Riuer is diuided into two armes; each
of them is a league and an halfe broad.</p>

<div class="c4">Chap. XXXIX.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How they came vnto the sea: and what happened vnto them in
all their voiage.</div>

<p>Halfe a league before they came to the sea, they came to
anker to rest themselues there about a day: for they were very
weary with rowing and out of heart. For by the space of many
daies they had eaten nothing but parched and sodden Maiz;
which they had by allowance euery day an headpeece ful by
strike for euery three men. While they rode there at anker
seuen canoes of Indians came to set vpon those, which they
brought with them. The Gouernor commanded armed men to
go aboord them, and to driue them farther off. They came also
against them by land through a thick wood, and a moorish
ground, and had staues with very sharp forked heads made of
the bones of fishes, and fought verie valiantly with vs, which
went out to encounter them. And the other that came in canoes
with their arrowes staid for them that came against them, and at
their comming both those that were on land, and those in the
canoes wounded some of vs: And seeing vs come neere them,
they turned their backs, and like swift horses among footemen
<!--044.png-->
<span class="pagenum">47</span>
gat away from vs; making some returnes, and reuniting themselues
together, going not past a bow shot off: for in so retiring
they shot, without receiuing any hurt of the Christians. For
though they had some bowes, yet they could not vse them; and
brake their armes with rowing to ouertake them. And the
Indians easily in their compasse went with their canoes, staying
and wheeling about as it had been in a skirmish, perceiuing that
those that came against them could not offend them. And the
more they stroue to come neere them, the more hurt they
receiued. Assoone as they had driuen them farther off they
returned to the brigandines. They staied two daies there: And
departed from thence vnto the place, where the arme of the Riuer
entreth into the sea. They sounded in the Riuer neere vnto the
Sea, and found 40. fathoms water. They staid there. And the
Gouernour commanded al and singular persons to speake their
minds touching their voiage, whether it were best to crosse ouer
to Nueua Espanna, committing themselues to the hie sea, or
whether they should keepe along the coast. There were sundry
opinions touching this matter; wherein Iohn Danusco, which
presumed much, and tooke much vpon him in the knowledge of
nauigation, and matters of the sea, although hee had but little
experience, mooued the Gouernour with his talke: and his
opinion was seconded by some others. And they affirmed, that
it was much better to passe by the hie sea, and crosse the gulfe,
which was three of foure parts the lesser trauell, because in going
along the coast, they went a great way about, by reason of the
compasse, which the land did make. Iohn Danusco said, that
he had seene the seacard, and that from the place where they
were, the coast ran East and West vnto Rio de las Palmas; and
from Rio de las Palmas to Nueua Espanna from North to South:
and therefore in sailing alwaies in sight of land would bee a great
compassing about and spending of much time; and that they
would be in great danger to be overtaken with winter before they
should get to the land of the Christians: and that in 10. or 12.
daies space, hauing good weather, they might bee there in crossing
ouer. The most part were against this opinion, and said, that it
was more safe to go along the coast, though they staied the longer:
because their ships were very weake and without decks, so that a
very little storme was enough to cast them away: and if they
should be hindred with calmes, or contrarie weather, through the
small store of vessels which they had to carrie water in, they
<!--045.png-->
<span class="pagenum">48</span>
should likewise fall into great danger: and that although the ships
were such as they might venture in them, yet hauing neither
Pilot nor Seacard to guide themselues, it was no good counsell to
crosse the gulfe. This opinion was confirmed by the greatest
part: and they agreed to go along the coast. At the time wherein
they sought to depart from thence, the cable of the anker of the
Gouernours brigandine brake, and the anker remained in the
Riuer. And albeit, they were neere the shore, yet it was so deepe,
that the Diuers diuing many times could neuer find it: which
caused great sadnes in the Gouernour, and in all those that
went with him in his brigandine: But with a grindstone
which they had, and certaine bridles which remained to some
of the Gentlemen, and men of worship which had horses,
they made a weight which serued in stead of an anker.
<span class="sidenote">They landed the 30. of May, 1539. Chap. 7. they
went foorth to sea Iuly 18, 1543.</span>
The 18. of Iuly, they went foorth to sea with faire
and prosperous weather for their voiage. And seeing
that they were gone two or three leagues from the
shore, the Captaines of the other brigandines ouertooke
them, and asked the Gouernour, wherefore he
did put off from the shore: and that if hee would leaue the coast,
he should say so; and he should not do it without the consent
of all: and that if hee did otherwise, they would not follow him,
but that euery one would doe what seemed best vnto himselfe.
The Gouernour answered, that hee would doe nothing without
their counsell, but that hee did beare off from the land to saile
the better and safer by night; and that the next day when time
serued, he would returne to the sight of land againe. They
sailed with a reasonable good wind that day and the night
following, and the next day till euening song, alwaies in fresh
water: whereat they wondred much: for they were very farre
from land. But the force of the current of the Riuer is so great,
and the coast there is so shallow and gentle, that the fresh water
entreth farre into the Sea. That euening on their right hand
they saw certaine creekes, whither they went, and rested there
that night: where Iohn Danusco with his reasons wonne them at
last, that all consented and agreed to commit themselues to the
maine Sea, alleaging, as he had done before, that it was a great
aduantage, and that their voyage would be much shorter. They
sailed two daies, and when they would haue come to sight of
land they could not, for the winde blew from the shore. On the
fourth day, seeing their fresh water began to faile, fearing necessitie
<!--046.png-->
<span class="pagenum">49</span>
and danger, they all complained of Iohn Danusco, and of
the Gouernour that followed his counsell: and euery one of the
Captaines said, that they would no more goe from the shore,
though the Gouernour went whither he would. It pleased God
that the winde changed though but a little: and at the end of
foure daies after they had put to sea, being alreadie destitute of
water, by force of rowing they got within sight of land, and with
great trouble recouered it, in an open roade. That euening the
winde came to the South, which on that coast is a crosse winde,
and draue the brigandines against the shore, because it blew very
hard, and the anchors weake, that they yeelded and began to
bend. The Gouernour commanded all men to leape into the
water, and going between them and the shore, and thrusting the
brigandines into the Sea assoone as the waue was past, they
saued them till the winde ceased.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Fresh water is commonlie found by diging in the
sands on the sea side.</span>
In the bay where they rode, after the tempest was past, they
went on shore, and with mattockes, which they had,
they digged certain pits, which grew full of fresh
water, where they filled all the casks which they had.
The next day they departed thence, and sailed two
daies, and entred into a creeke like vnto a poole,
fenced from the South winde, which then did blow, and was
against them: and there they staied foure daies, not being able
to get out: and when the Sea was calm they rowed out: they
sailed that day, and toward euening the winde grew so strong
that it draue them on the shore, and they were sorie that they
had put foorth from the former harbour: for assoone as night
approched a storme began to rise in the Sea, and the winde still
waxed more and more violent with a tempest. The brigandines
lost one another: two of them, which bare more into the Sea,
entred into an arme of the Sea, which pearced into the land two
leagues beyond the place where the other were that night. The
fiue which staied behinde, being alwaies a league, and halfe a
league the one from the other, met together, without any knowledge
the one of the other, in a wilde roade, where the winde
<!--047.png-->
<span class="pagenum">50</span>
and the waues droue them on shore: for their anchors did
strengthen and came home; and they could not rule their oares,
putting seuen or eight men to every oare, which rowed to seaward:
and all the rest leaped into the water, and when the waue
was past that draue the brigandine on shore, they thrust it againe
into Sea with all the diligence and might that they had. Others,
while another waue was in comming, with bowles laued out the
water that came in ouerboord.
<span class="sidenote">A swarme of grieuous Moskitoes.</span>
While they were in this tempest
in great feare of being cast away in that place, from midnight
forward they endured an intollerable torment of an
infinite swarme of Moskitoes which fell upon them,
which assoone as they had stung the flesh, it so
infected it, as though they had bin venomous. In the morning
the Sea was asswaged and the wind slaked, but not the Muskitoes:
the sailes which were white seemed blacke with them in the
morning. Those which rowed, vnless others kept them away,
were not able to row. Hauing passed the feare &amp; danger of the
storme, beholding the deformities of their faces, and the blows
which they gaue themselves to driue them away, one of them
laughed at another. They met all together in the creek where
the two brigandines were, which outwent their fellowes. There
was found a skumme, which they call Copee, which the Sea
casteth vp, and it is like pitch, wherewith in some places, where
pitch is wanting, they pitch their ships: there they pitched their
brigandines. They rested two daies, and then eftsoones proceeded
on their voyage. They sailed two daies more, and landed
in a Bay or arme of the Sea, where they staied two daies. The
same day that they went from thence sixe men went vp in a
canoe toward the head of it, and could not see the end of it.
They put out from thence with a South winde, which was against
them: but because it was little, and for the great desire they had
to shorten their voyage, they put out to sea by force of oares, and
for all that made very little way with great labour in two daies,
and went under the lee of a small Island into an arme of the Sea,
which compassed it about. While they were there, there fell out
such weather, that they gave God many thankes, that they had
found out such an harbour. There was great store of fish in that
place, which they tooke with nets, which they had, and hookes.
Heere a man cast an hooke and a line into the Sea, and tied the
end of it to his arme, and a fish caught it, and drew him into the
water vnto the necke: and it pleased God that he remembred
<!--048.png-->
<span class="pagenum">51</span>
himselfe of a knife that he had, and cut the line with it. There
they abode fourteen daies: and at the end of them it pleased
God to send them faire weather, for which with great deuotion
they appointed a procession, and went in procession along the
strand, beseeching God to bring them to a land, where they
might serue him in better sort.</p>

<div class="c4">Chap. XLI.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How they came to the Riuer of Panuco in Nueua Espanna.</div>

<p>In all the coast wheresoeuer they digged they found fresh
water: there they filled their vessels; and the procession being
ended, embarked themselues, and going alwaies in sight of the
shore they sailed sixe daies. Iohn Danusco said that it would
doe well to beare out to seaward: for he had seene the Seacard,
and remembred that from Rio de las Palmas forward the coast
did runne from North to South, and thitherto they had runne
from East to West, and in his opinion, by his reckoning, Rio de
las Palmas could not be farre off, from where they were.
<span class="sidenote">At the Northside of the Gulfe of Mexico is verie
low land, saue in this one place.</span>
That
same night they put to sea, and in the morning they saw Palme
leaues floting, and the coast, which ranne North and South:
from midday forward they saw great Mountaines, which vntill
then they had not seene: for from this place to
Puerto de Spiritu Santo, where they first landed in
Florida, was a very plaine and low countrey: and
therefore it cannot be descried, vnlesse a man come
very neere it. By that which they saw, they thought
that they had ouershot Rio de Palmas that night,
which is 60. leagues from the Riuer of Panuco, which
is in Nueua Espanna. They assembled all together, and some
said it was not good to saile by night, lest they should ouershoot
the Riuer of Panuco: and others said, it was not well to lose
time while it was fauourable, and that it could not be so neere
that they should passe it that night: and they agreed to take
away halfe the sailes, and so saile all night. Two of the brigandines,
which sailed that night with all their sailes, by breake of
day had ouershot the Riuer of Panuco without seeing it. Of the
fiue that came behind, the first that came vnto it was that wherein
Calderan was Captaine. A quarter of a league before they came
at it, and before they did see it, they saw the water muddie,
<!--049.png-->
<span class="pagenum">52</span>
and knew it to be fresh water: and comming right against the
Riuer, they saw, where it entred into the Sea, that the water
brake vpon a shold. And because there was no man there that
knew it, they were in doubt whether they should goe in, or goe
along, and they resolued to goe in: and before they came vnto
the current, they went close to the shore, and entred into the
port: and assoone as they were come in, they saw Indian men
and women apparelled like Spaniards: whom they asked in what
countrey they were?
<span class="sidenote">The Riuer of Panuca: the towne 15. leagues from
the mouth of the Riuer.</span>
They answered in Spanish, that it was the
Riuer of Panuco, and that the towne of the Christians
was 15. leagues vp within the land. The ioy that all
of them receiued vpon these newes cannot sufficiently
be expressed: for it seemed vnto them, that at that
instant they were borne again. And many went on
shore and kissed the ground, and kneeling on their
knees, with lifting vp their hands and eyes to heauen, they all
ceased not to giue God thankes. Those which came after,
assoone as they saw Calderon come to an anchor with his
brigandine in the Riuer, presently went thither, and came into
the hauen. The other two brigandines which had ouershot the
place, put to sea to returne backe to seeke the rest, and could
not doe it, because the wind was contrarie and the Sea growne:
they were afraid of being cast away, and recouering the shore
they cast anchor. While they rode there a storme arose: and
seeing that they could not abide there, much lesse endure at
Sea, they resolued to runne on shore; and as the brigandines
were but small, so did they draw but little water; and where they
were it was a sandie coast. By which occasion the force of their
sailes draue them on shore, without any hurt of them that were
in them. As those that were in the port of Panuco at this time
were in great ioy, so these felt a double griefe in their hearts: for
they knew not what was become of their fellowes, nor in what
countrey they were, and feared it was a countrey of Indian
enemies. They landed two leagues below the port: and when
they saw themselues out of the danger of the Sea, euery one
tooke of that which he had, as much as he could carrie on his
backe: and they trauelled vp into the countrey, and found
Indians, which told them where the fellowes were; and gaue
them good entertainement: wherewith their sadnes was turned
into ioy, and they thanked God most humbly for their deliuerance
out of so many dangers.</p>

<div class="c4">Chap. XLII.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">How they came to Panuco, and how they were receiued of
the inhabitants.</div>

<p>From the time that they put out of Rio Grande to the sea,
at their departure from Florida, vntil they arriued in the Riuer of
Panuco, were 52 daies.
<span class="sidenote">They arriued in the Riuer of Panuco, 1543. Septem.
10.</span>
They came into the Riuer
of Panuco the 10. of September 1543. They went vp
the Riuer with their brigandines. They trauelled
foure daies; and because the wind was but little, and
many times it serued them not, because of the many
turnings which the Riuer maketh, and the great
current, drawing them vp by towing, and that in many places:
for this cause they made very little way, and with great labour;
and seeing the execution of their desire to be deferred, which
was to come among Christians, and to see the celebration of
diuine seruice, which so long time they had not seene; they left
the brigandines with the mariners, and went by land to Panuco.
All of them were apparrelled in Deeres skins tanned and died
blacke, to wit, cotes, hose, and shooes. When they came to
Panuco, presently they went to the Church to pray and giue God
thankes, that so miraculously had saued them. The townesmen
which before were aduertised by the Indians, and knew of their
arriual, caried some of them to their houses, and entertained
them, whom they knew, and had acquaintance of, or because
they were their Countrimen. The Alcalde Mayor tooke the
Gouernour home to his house: and commanded al the rest,
assoone as they came, to be lodged 6. &amp; 6. and 10. &amp; 10. according
to the habilitie of euery townesman. And all of them
were prouided for by their hostes of many hennes and bread of
Maiz, and fruites of the Countrie, which are such as be in the
Isle of Cuba, whereof, before I haue spoken.
<span class="sidenote">The description of Panuco.</span>
The towne of
Panuco may containe aboue 70 families; the most
of their houses are of lime and stone, and some made
of timber, and all of them are thatched. It is a
poore Countrie, and there is neither gold nor siluer
in it: The inhabitants live there in great abundance of victuals
and seruants. The richest haue not aboue 500. crownes rent a
yeere, and that is in cotton clothes and hennes and Maiz, which
<!--051.png-->
<span class="pagenum">54</span>
the Indians there seruants doe giue them for tribute.
<span class="sidenote">311. Christians arriued at Panuco.</span>
There arriued there; of those that came out of Florida,
three hundred and eleuen Christians. Presently the
Alcalde Mayor sent one of the townesmen in post to
aduertise the Viceroy, Don Antonio de Mendo&ccedil;a,
which was resident in Mexico, that of the people that went with
Don Ferdinando de Soto to discouer and conquer Florida,
three hundred and eleuen men were arriued there, that seeing
they were imploied in his Maiesties seruice, he would take some
order to prouide for them. Whereat the Viceroy, and all the
inhabitants of Mexico wondred. For they thought they were
miscarried, because they had trauelled so farre within the maine
land of Florida, and had no newes of them for so long a time:
and it seemed a wonderfull thing vnto them, how they could
saue themselues so long among Infidels, without any fort,
wherein they might fortifie themselues, and without any other
succour at all. Presently the Viceroy sent a warrant, wherein
hee commanded, that whithersoeuer they went, they should giue
them victuals, and as many Indians for their carriages as they
needed: and where they would not furnish them, they might
take those things that were necessarie perforce without incurring
any danger of law. This warrant was so readilie obeyed,
that by the way before they came to the townes, they came to
receiue them with hennes, and victuals.</p>

<div class="c4">Chap. XLIII.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Of the fauour which they found at the hands of the Viceroy,
and of the inhabitants of the Citie of Mexico.</div>

<p>From Panuco to the great Citie Temistitan Mexico is 60.
leagues; and other 60. from Panuco to the Port de Vera Cruz,
where they take shipping for Spaine, and those that come from
Spaine do land to go for Nueua Espanna. These three townes
stand in a triangle: to wit, Vera Cruz, to the South, Panuco to
the North, and Mexico to the West, 60. leagues assunder. The
Countrie is so inhabited with Indians, that from towne to towne,
those which are farthest, are but a league, and halfe a league
assunder. Some of them that came from Florida, staied a
moneth in Panuco to rest themselues, others fifteene daies, and
euery one as long as he listed: for there was none that shewed
<!--052.png-->
<span class="pagenum">55</span>
a sower countenance to his guests, but rather gaue them any
thing that they had, and seemed to be grieued when they took
their leaue. Which was to be beleeued. For the victuals,
which the Indians doe pay them for tribute, are more than they
can spend: and in that towne is no commerce; and there dwelt
but few Spaniards there, and they were glad of their companie.
The Alcalde Mayor diuided all the Emperours clothes which he
had (which there they pay him for his tribute) among those that
would come to receiue them. Those which had shirts of maile
left, were glad men: for they had a horse for one shirt of maile:
Some horsed themselues: and such as could not (which were
the greatest part) tooke their iournie on foote: in which they
were well receiued of the Indians that were in the townes, and
better serued, then they could haue been in their owne houses,
though they had been well to liue. For if they asked one hen
of an Indian, they brought them foure: and if they asked any of
the Countrie fruit, though it were a league off, they
ran presently for it.
<span class="sidenote">This is the manner of China to carrie men
chaires.</span>
And if any Christian found
himselfe euill at ease, they carried him in a chaire
from one towne to another. In whatsoeuer towne
they came, the Cacique, by an Indian which carried
a rod of Iustice in his hand, whom they call Tapile, that is to
say, a sergeant, commanded them to prouide victuals for them,
and Indians to beare burdens of such things as they had, and
such as were needfull to carrie them that were sicke. The
Viceroy sent a Portugall 20. leagues from Mexico, with great
store of sugar, raisons of the Sunne, and conserues, and other
things fit for sicke folkes, for such as had neede of them: and
had giuen order to cloth them all at the Emperours charges.
And their approch being knowne by the citizens of Mexico, they
went out of the towne to receiue them: and with great courtesie,
requesting them in fauour to come to their houses, euery one
carried such as hee met home with him, and clothed them euery
one the best they could: so that he which had the meanest
apparrell, it cost aboue 30. ducats. As many as were willing to
come to the Viceroyes house he commanded to be apparelled,
and such as were persons of qualitie sate at his table: and there
was a table in his house for as many of the meaner sort as would
come to it: and he was presently informed who euery one was,
to shew him the courtesie that he deserued. Some of the Conquerors
did set both gentlemen and clownes at their owne table,
<!--053.png-->
<span class="pagenum">56</span>
and many times made the seruant sit cheeke by cheeke by his
master: and chiefly the officers and men of base condition did
so: for those which had better education did enquire who euery
one was, and made difference of persons: but all did what they
could with a good will: and euery one told them whom they
had in their houses, that they should not trouble themselues,
nor thinke themselues the worse, to take that which they gaue
them: for they had bin in the like case, and had bin relieued of
others, and that this was the custome of that countrey. God
reward them all: and God grant, that those which it pleased
him to deliuer out of Florida, and to bring againe into Christendome,
may serue him: and vnto those that died in that countrey,
and vnto all that beleeue in him and confesse his holy faith,
God for his mercie sake grant the kingdome of heauen. Amen.</p>

<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> on the West side of Florida.</span>
From the Port de Spiritu Santo, where they landed
when they entred into Florida, to the Prouince of
Ocute, which may bee 400. leagues, little more or
lesse, is a verie plaine Countrie, and hath many lakes
and thicke woods, and in some places they are
of wild pine trees; and is a weake soile: There is in
it neither Mountaine nor hill. The Countrie of Ocute is more
fat and fruitfull; it hath thinner woods, and very goodly medows
vpon the Riuers. From Ocute to Cutifachiqui may be 130. leagues;
80. leagues thereof are desert, and haue many groues of wild
Pine trees. Through the wildernesse great Riuers doe passe.
From Cutifachiqui to Xuala, may be 250. leagues: it is al an
hilly Countrie. Cutifachiqui and Xuala stand both in plaine
grounds, hie, and haue goodly medows on the Riuers. From
thence forward to Chiaha, Co&ccedil;a, and Talise, is plaine ground,
dry and fat, and very plentifull of Maiz. From Xuala to Tascalu&ccedil;a
may be 250. leagues. From Tascalu&ccedil;a to Rio Grande, or
the Great Riuer, may be 300. leagues: the Countrie is low, and
full of lakes. From Rio Grande forwarde, the Countrie is hier
and more champion, and best peopled of all the land of Florida.
<!--054.png--><span class="pagenum">57</span>
And along this Riuer from Aquixo to Pacaha, and Coligoa, are
150. leagues: the Countrie is plaine, and the woods thinne, and
in some places champion, very fruitfull and pleasant. From
Coligoa to Autiamque are 250. leagues of hillie Countrie. From
Autiamque to Aguacay, may be 230. leagues of plaine ground.
From Aguacay to the Riuer of Daycao 120. leagues, all hillie

<p>The bread which they eate in all the land of Florida is of
Maiz, which is like course millet. And this maiz is common in
all the Islandes and West Indies from the Antiles forward.
There are also in Florida great store of Walnuts and Plummes,
Mulberries, and Grapes. They sow and gather their Maiz
euery one their seuerall crop. The fruits are common to all:
for they grow abroad in the open fields in great abundance,
without any neede of planting or dressing. Where there be
Mountaines, there be chestnuts: they are somewhat smaller then
the chestnuts of Spaine.
<span class="sidenote">Soft Walnuts Eastward from Rio Grande.</span>

<span class="sidenote">Hard Walnuts Westward from Rio Grande.</span>
From Rio Grande Westward, the
Walnuts differ from those that grow more Eastward:
for they are soft, and like vnto Acornes: And those
which grow from Rio Grande to Puerto del Spiritu
Santo for the most part are hard; and the trees and
Walnuts in shew like those of Spaine. There is a
fruit through all the Countrie which groweth on a
plant like Ligoacan, which the Indians doe plant.
The fruit is like vnto Peares Riall: it hath a verie good smell,
and an excellent taste. There groweth another plant in the open
field, which beareth a fruit like vnto strawberries, close to the
ground, which hath a verie good taste. The Plummes are of two
kindes, red and gray, of the making and bignesse of nuts, and
haue three or foure stones in them. These are better than all
the plummes of Spaine, &amp; they make farre better Prunes of them.
In the Grapes there is onelie want of dressing: for though they
<!--055.png-->
<span class="pagenum">58</span>
bee big, they have a great Kirnell. All other fruits are very
perfect, and lesse hurtfull than those of Spaine.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Beasts.</span>
There are in Florida many Beares, and Lyons,
Wolues, Deere, Dogges, Cattes, Marterns, and Conies.
<span class="sidenote">Fowles.</span>
There be many wild Hennes as big as Turkies, Partridges
small like those of Africa, Cranes, Duckes, Pigeons,
Thrushes and Sparrowes. There are certaine Blacke
birds bigger then Sparrowes, and lesser then Stares. There are
Gosse Hawkes, Falcons, Ierfalcons, and all Fowles of prey that
are in Spaine.</p>

<p>The Indians are well proportioned. Those of the plaine
Countries are taller of bodie, and better shapen, then those of
the Mountaines. Those of the Inland haue greater store of
Maiz, and commodities of the Countrie, then those that dwell
vpon the sea coast. The Countrie along the sea coast is barren
and poore: and the people more warlike. The coast runneth
from Puerto del Spiritu Santo to Apalache, East and West; and
from Apalache to Rio de las Palmas from East to West: from
Rio de las Palmas vnto Nueua Espanna from North to South.
It is a gentle coast, but it hath many sholdes, and great shelues
of sand.</p>

<p>The right honourable Don Antonio de Mendo&ccedil;a being sent

had sent many ships along the coast of Nueua Espanna to discouer

himselfe to desire to do the like, as viceroy of Nueua Espanna;
and hereupon they fell out: for Cortez said that he was general
and discouerer of the South sea, and that it belonged to him to
set forth those voyages. On the other side, the lord Don
Antonio alledged that it belonged to him to make that discouery,
as being viceroy of Nueua Espanna. So that they fell at great
variance, and Cortez returned into Spaine to complaine vnto the
Emperour. Don Antonio in the meane season hauing obteined
knowledge of the voiage, which Andrew Dorantez (who was one
of the company of Pamphilo Naruaez that escaped, as you may

<span class="sidenote">Store of golde, siluer, and precious stones in
Topira.</span>
There are no great cities there, yet are the houses built of stone,
and are very good, and in them they haue great store
of gold, which is as it were lost, because they know
not what vse to put it to. The people weare
Emeralds and other precious iewels vpon their
bodies: they are valiant, hauing very strong armour
made of siluer, fashioned after diuers shapes of beasts. They
worship for their gods such things as they haue in their houses,
as namely hearbes, and birdes, and sing songs vnto them in their
language, which differeth but litle from that of Culiacan. They
told the Frier that they were willing to become Christians, and
the Emperors subjects, for they were without a gouernour; with
condition that no man should hurt them: and that they would
change their golde for such things as they wanted. Commandement
was giuen, that they should bee receiued without
doing them any displeasure. Neere vnto this countrey there
is another Prouince heretofore discouered by our men, where
the people go naked without any thing before them:
they are very hardly reduced to Christianitie, and they
are valiant and stoute. Their houses are couered with straw.
They seeke no other riches but to feede cattel. They goe
at certaine seasons to their sacrifices into a valley situate
in that Prouince, which is inhabited with people, esteemed by
those of the countrey as saints and priests, whom they call
Chichimecas, which dwell in the woods without houses: and
<!--058.png-->
<span class="pagenum">61</span>
they eate such things as they of the countrey giue them of almes.
They goe naked, and are tanned in the smoke, and tye their
priuie member with a string vnto their knee, and the women likewise
goe starke naked. They haue certaine temples couered with
strawe, with small round windowes full of skuls of dead
men; before their temple is a great round ditch, the brim
whereof is compassed with the figure of a serpent made of gold
and siluer, and with another mixture of vnknowen metals: and
this serpent holdeth his tayle in his mouth. They of this valley
from time to time cast lots, whose lucke it shal be to be sacrificed,
and they make him great cheere, on whom the lotte falleth, and
with great ioy they crowne him with flowers vpon a bed prepared
in the sayd ditch all full of flowres and sweete hearbes, on which
they lay him along, and lay great store of dry wood on both sides
of him, and set on fire on eyther part, and so he dyeth. Where
he continueth so quietly without being bound, as though hee
did something, wherein he tooke great pleasure. And they say
that hee is a Saint, and doe worshippe him for that yeere, and
sing prayses, and Hymnes vnto him and afterward set vp his
head with the rest in order within those windowes. Also they
sacrifice their prisoners, whom they burn in another deeper ditch,
and not with the foresayde ceremonies. The Spanyards which
are in Xalisco write, that hauing good assistance, they hope that
those people will become Christians. The Countrey is very good
and fruitfull, and hath great store of good and wholesome waters.</p>

A Letter of Francis Vazquez de Coronado, Gouernour of Nueua
Galicia, to the lord Don Antonio de Mendo&ccedil;a, Viceroy
of Nueua Espanna. Dated in Saint Michael of Culiacan,
the 8. of March, 1539.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Of the hard passage from Saint Michael of Culiacan to Topira.
The description of that Prouince, and of another neere
vnto the same, very rich in gold and precious stones.
The number, of the people which Vazquez caried with
him in his iourney thither; and how greatly Frier Marcus
of Ni&ccedil;a is honoured by the Indians of Petatlan.</div>

<p>By the help of God I meane to set forward from this City of
S. Michael of Culiacan toward Topira the 10. of April: neither
can I any sooner set forward, because the powder and match
<!--059.png--><span class="pagenum">62</span>
which your Lordship sendeth mee, cannot be brought thither,
before that time, and I thinke it be now in Compostella. Besides
this, I am to passe many leagues ouer mightie high mountaines
which reach vp to the skyes, and ouer a Riuer, which at this
present is so bigge and swollen, that it can in no place be waded
ouer. And if I depart at the time aforesayde, they say wee may
wade ouer it. They tolde mee that from hence to Topira was
not aboue 50 leagues; and I haue learned since that it is aboue
foure score leagues. I doe not remember that I haue written to
your Lordshippe the information which I haue of Topira: and
though I had written thereof vnto you, yet because that since that
time I haue learned something more, I thinke it meete to signifie
them vnto your Lordshippe in these my letters. It may please
your honour therefore to vnderstand, that they tell mee, that
Topira is a very populous Prouince, lying betweene two riuers,
and that there are aboue 50. inhabited townes therein. And
that beyond the same there is another Countrey greater then
it, the name whereof the Indians could not tell mee, wherein
there is great store of victuals of Maiz, French peason, Axi or
Pepper, Melons, and Gourds, and great store of Hennes of
the countrey.
<span class="sidenote">These may seeme to be the Pintados mentioned by
Frier Marco de Niza in his <a href="#Chap_2">2. Chap.</a></span>
The people weare on their bodies golde, Emeralds,
and other precious stones, and are serued commonly in golde
and siluer, wherewith they couer their houses: and the chiefe
men weare great chaines of golde well wrought, about their necks
and are apparelled with paynted garments, and haue
store of wilde kine; and they say they enter not into
their countrey, because themselues haue no great store
of people: those Indians being many in number, and
very valiant. That which here I say, I learned by
two other relations of Indians dwelling neere vnto
them. I meane to set forward at the time before mentioned, and
I carrie with me 150 horsemen, and twelue spare horsemen, and
200. footmen, crossebowmen, and gunners. I take also with me
liue hogs, sheepe and all such things as I can get for money:
assure your Lordship that I meane not to returne to Mexico vntil
I be able to informe your honour more perfectly, what the state
of this place is: and if I find ought that we may doe good in, I
will stay there, vntill I haue aduertised your Lordship, that you
may command what you will haue done: and if it fall out so
vnluckily, that there is nothing of importance, I will seeke to discouer
100. leagues farther, wherein (I hope in God) there will be
<!--060.png-->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
something found in which your Lordship may imploy all these
gentlemen and those which shall come hither hereafter. I thinke
I cannot chuse but stay there: and the waters, the seasons, the
disposition of the countrey, and other accidents wil direct mee
what is best to be done. Frier Marco de Ni&ccedil;a entred a good
way into the countrey, accompanied with Stephan Dorantez, the
7. of February last past: when I departed from them, I left them
with aboue 100. Indians of Petatlan, and from the time of their
comming thither they greatly honoured the father, shewing him
all the courtesies they could possibly. I cannot send you, nor
describe vnto you his entrance among them better then I have
done in all my relations which I wrote in my letters from Compostella,
and I signified vnto you all things to the full from the citie of
Michael: and though there is but the tenth part of those things
it is a great matter. Herewithall I haue sent your Lordship a
Letter, which I receiued from him: and I beleeue he may trauel
many leagues farther in that sort. He saith, that if he finde any
good countrey, he will write to mee thereof: I will not goe thither
without informing your Lordship of my iourney. I hope in God
that by one way or other wee shall discouer some good thing.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2"><a name="a208" id="a208"></a>A Letter written by the most honourable Lord Don Antonio de
Mendo&ccedil;a, Vice-roy of Nueua Espanna, to the Emperours
Maiestie.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Of certaine Noblemen which sought to discouer the end of the
firme land of Nueua Espanna toward the North. The
arriuall of Vazquez de Coronado with Frier Marco at S.
Michael of Culiacan, with commission to the Gouernours
of those parts to pacifie the Indians, and not to make
them slaues any more.</div>

<p>In the ships that went last from hence (whereof Michael de
Vsnago was Admirall) I wrote vnto your Maiestie, how I sent
two Franciscan Friers to discouer the ende of this firme land,
which stretcheth to the North. And because their iourney fell
out to greater purpose then was looked for, I will declare the
whole matter from the beginning. It may please your Maiestie
to call to minde how often I wrote vnto your Highnesse, that I
desired to know the ende of this Prouince of Nueua Espanna,
becavse it is so great a countrey, and that we haue yet no knowledge
<!--061.png-->
<span class="pagenum">64</span>
thereof. Neither had I onely this desire: for Nunno de
Guzman departed out of this city of Mexico with 400 horsemen,
and 14000. Indians footemen borne in these Indias, being the
best men, and the best furnished, which haue beene seene in
these parts: and he did so litle with them, that the most part of
them were consumed in the enterprize, and could not enter nor
discouer any more then already was discouered. After this the
saide Nunno Guzman beeing Gouernour of Nueua Galacia, sent
Captaines and Horsemen foorth diuers times, which sped no
better then he had done. Likewise the Marques de valle Hernando
Cortez sent a captaine with 2. ships to discouer the coast,
which 2. ships and the captaine perished. After that he sent
againe 2. other ships, one of which was diuided from her consort
and the Master and certaine mariners slue the captaine, and
vsurped ouer the ship.
<span class="sidenote">This was the Port of Santa Cruz in the Isle of
California.</span>
After this they came to an
Island, where the Master with certaine mariners
going on land, the Indians of the countrey slew them
and tooke their boat: and the ship with those that
were in it, returned to the coast of Nueua Galacia,
where it ran on ground. By the men which came home
in this ship, the Marques had knowledge of the countrey
which they had discouered: and then, either for the
discontentment which hee had with the bishop of Saint
Domingo, and with the Iudges of this royal audience in
Mexico, or rather because of his so prosperous successe in
all things here in Nueua Espanna, without seeking any farther
intelligence of the state of that Island, he set forward on that
voyage with 3. Ships, and with certaine footemen and horsemen,
not throughly furnished with things necessary; which fell out so
contrary to his expectation, that the most part of the people
which he carryed with him, dyed of hunger. And although he
had ships, and a Countrey very neere him abounding with
victuals, yet could hee neuer finde meanes to conquer it, but
rather it seemed, that God miraculously did hide it from him:
and so he returned home without atchieuing ought else of
moment. After this, hauing heere in my company Andrew
Dorantez, which is one of those who were in the voyage of
Pamphilo Naruaez I often was in hand with him, supposing that
he was able to doe your Maiestie great seruice, to imploy him
with fortie or fiftie horses, to search out the secret of those parts:
and hauing prouided all things necessary for his iourney, and
<!--062.png-->
<span class="pagenum">65</span>
spent much money in that behalfe, the matter was broken off, I
wot not how, and that enterprise was giuen ouer. Yet of the
things which were prouided for that purpose, I had left mee a
Negro, which returned from the foresayde voyage of Naruaez,
with Dorantez, and certaine slaues which I had bought, and
certaine Indians which I had gathered together, who were borne
in those North partes, whome I sent with Frier Marco de Ni&ccedil;a,
and his companion a Franciscan Frier, because they had bene
long trauelled, and exercised in those partes, and had great
experience in the affaires of the Indies, and were men of good
life and conscience, for whom I obtained leaue of their superiours:
and so they went with Frances Vazquez de Coronado, gouernour
of Nueua Galicia vnto the Citie of Saint Michael of Culiacan,
which is the last Prouince subdued by the Spaniards towarde
that quarter, being two hundred leagues distant from this Citie of
Mexico. Assoone as the Gouernour, and the Friers were come
vnto that Citie, hee sent certaine of those Indians which I had
giuen him, home into their Countrey, to signifie, and declare to
the people of the same, That they were to vnderstand, that your
Maiestie had commaunded they should not hereafter bee made
slaues, and that they should not be afrayd any more, but might
returne vnto their houses, and liue peaceably in them, (for before
that time they had bin greatly troubled by the euill dealings
which were vsed toward them) and that your Maiestie would
cause them to be chastened, which were the causes of their vexation.
With these Indians about twentie dayes after returned
about 400 men; which comming before the gouernour said vnto
him, that they came on the behalfe of al their Countrey-men, to
tell him, that they desired to see and know those men which did
them so great a pleasure as to suffer them to returne to their
houses, and to sow Maiz for their sustenance: for by the space
of many yeres they were driuen to flee into the mountaines,
hiding themselues like wild beasts, for feare lest they should be
made slaues, and that they and all the rest of their people were
ready to doe whatsoeuer should bee commaunded them. Whom
the gouernour comforted with good wordes, and gaue them
victuals, and stayed them with him three or foure dayes, wherein
the Friers taught them to make the signe of the Crosse, and to
learne the name of our Lorde Iesus Christ, and they with great
diligence sought to learne the same. After these dayes hee sent
them home againe, willing them not to be afraid, but to be quiet,
<!--063.png-->
<span class="pagenum">66</span>
giuing them apparel, beades, kniues, and other such like things,
which I had giuen him for such purposes. The sayde Indians
departed very well pleased, and said, that whensoeuer hee would
send for them, they and many others would come to doe whatsoeuer
he would command them. The entrance being thus prepared,
Frier Marco and his companion, with the Negro and other
slaues, and Indians which I had giuen him, went forward on their
voyage 10. or 12. dayes after. And because I had likewise
aduertisement of a certaine Prouince called Topira situate in the
mountaines, and had appointed the gouernour Vasquez de Coronado,
that he should vse meanes to learne the state thereof: he
supposing this to be a matter of great moment, determined himselfe
to goe and search it, hauing agreed with the said Frier, that
he should returne by that part of the mountaine, to meete with
him in a certaine valley called Valle de los Cora&ccedil;ones, beeing
120. leagues distant from Culiacan. The gouernour trauelling
into this prouince (as I haue written in my former letters) found
great scarcity of victuals there, and the mountaines so craggy, that
he could finde no way to passe forward, and was inforced to
returne home to Saint Michael: so that aswell in chusing of
the entrance, as in not being able to finde the way, it seemeth
unto all men, that God would shut vp the gate to all those,
which by strength of humane force haue gone about to attempt
this enterprise, and hath reuieled it to a poore and bare-footed
Frier. And so the Frier beganne to enter into the Land, who
because he found his entrance so well prepared, was very well
receiued; and because he wrote the whole successe of his
voyage, according to the instruction which I had giuen him to
vndertake the same, I wil not write any more at large, but send
your Maiestie this copy of all such things as he obserued in the
same.</p>

Espanna.</div>

<div class="c3">Chap. 1.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Frier Marco de Nica departeth from Saint Michael in the
Prouince of Culiacan, standing in 24. degrees of Northerly
latitude: and comming to the Towne of Petatlan, receiueth
many courtesies of the Indians there. Departing
from thence, he had information of many Islands, and of
a great countrey inhabited with ciuil people; he commeth
to Vacupa: where during his aboad, he heard newes of
Ceuola, and of the state of the 7. Cities, and of other
prouinces, and of the rich Islands of perles, which extend
northward vpon the coast.</div>

<p>I Frier Marco de Nica of the order of S. Francis, for the execution
of the instruction of the right honourable lord Don Antonio
de Mendo&ccedil;a, Vice-roy and Captaine Generall for the Emperors
Maiestie in New Spaine, departed from the towne of S. Michael
in the prouince of Culiacan on Friday the 7. of March, in the
yeere 1539. hauing for my companion Frier Honoratus, and
carying with me Stephan a Negro; belonging to Andrew Dorantez,
and certaine of those Indians which the sayde lord Vice-roy had
made free, and bought for this purpose: whom Frances Vazquez
de Coronado gouernour of Nueua Galicia deliuered me, and with
many other Indians of Petatlan, and of the towne called Cuchillo,
which is some 50. leagues from Petatlan, who came to the valley
of Culiacan, shewing themselues to bee exceeding glad, because
they were certified by the Indians which had bin set free, whom
the said gouernour had sent before to aduertise them of their
libertie, that none of them from thenceforth should be made
slaues, and that no man should inuade them, nor vse them badly;
signifying vnto them, that the Emperors Maiesty had willed and
commanded that it should be so.
<span class="sidenote">Petatlan a towne.</span>
With the foresaid
company I went on my voyage vntill I came to the
towne of Petatlan, finding all the way great intertainment, and
<!--065.png-->
<span class="pagenum">68</span>
prouision of victuals, with roses, flowres, and other such things,
and bowers which they made for me of chalke and boughs platted
together in all places where there were no houses. In this towne
of Petatlan I rested 3. dayes, because my companion Honoratus
fell so sicke, that I was constrained to leaue him there behinde.</p>

<p>Then, according to my said instruction, I followed my iourney
as the holy Ghost did leade me without any merit of mine, hauing
in my company the said Stephan the Negro of Dorantez, and
certaine of the Indians which had bin set at liberty, and many of
the people of the countrey, which gaue me great intertainment
and welcome in all places where I came, and made mee bowers of
trees, giuing me such victuals as they had, although they were
but small: because (as they said) it had not rained there in 3
yeres, and because the Indians of this countrey sought means
rather to hide themselues, then to sowe corne, for feare of the
Christians of the Towne of S. Michael, which were wont to make
in-roades euen to that place, and to warre vpon them, and to
cary them away captiues.
<span class="sidenote">The island of Saint Iago.</span>
In all this way, which may be about
25 or 30. leagues from that part of Petatlan, I saw nothing
worthy the noting, saue that there came to seeke me certaine
Indians from the Island, where Fernando Cortez the Marques of
the valley had bin, of whom I was informed, that it
was an Island, and not firme land, as some suppose
it to be. They came to the firme land vpon certaine
rafts of wood: and from the maine to the island is
but halfe a league by sea, litle more or lesse.
<span class="sidenote">A great island, and 30. small islands, which seeme
to be the new islands of California rich in pearles.</span>
Likewise
certaine Indians of another Island greater then this
came to visit me, which island is farther off, of whom
I was informed that there were 30. other smal islands,
which were inhabited, but had smal store of victuals,
sauing 2. which haue Maiz or corne of the countrey.
These Indians had about their necks many great shels
which were mother of Pearle. I shewed them pearles
which I carryed with me for a shew, and they told
me that there were in the Islands great store of them, and those
very great: howbeit I saw none of them. I followed my voyage
through a desert of 4. dayes iourney, hauing in my company both
the Indians of the islands, and those of the mountaines which I
<span class="sidenote">A desert foure daies iourney.</span>
had
passed, and at the end of this desert I found other Indians
which maruelled to see me, because they had no knowledge of
any Christians, hauing no traffike nor conuersation with those
<!--066.png--><span class="pagenum">69</span>
Indians which I had passed,
in regard of the great
desert which was between them. These Indians
interteined me exceeding courteously, and gaue me
great store of victuals, and sought to touch my garments, and
called me Hayota, which in their language signifieth A man come
from heauen. These Indians I aduertised by my interpreter,
according to my instructions, in the knowledge of our Lord God
in heauen, and of the
Emperor.
<span class="sidenote">This was the valley of CoraÃ§ones.</span>
In
these countries and in all
places els by all wayes and meanes possible, I sought information
where any Countreys were of more Cities and people of civilitie
and vnderstanding, then those which I had found: and I could
heare no newes of any such: howbeit they tolde mee, that foure
or fiue dayes iourney within the Countrey, at the foote of the
mountaines, there is a large and mightie plaine,
wherein they tolde mee, that there were many great
Townes, and people clad in Cotton: and when I
shewed them certaine Metals which I carryed with mee, to learne
what riche Metals were in the Lande, they tooke the minerall of
Golde and tolde mee, that thereof were vesselles among the
people of that plaine, and that they carryed certaine round greene
stones hanging at their nostrilles, and at their eares, and that they
haue certaine thinne plates of that Golde, wherewith they scrape
off their sweat, and that the walles of their Temples are couered
therewith, and that they vse it in all their household vessels.
And because this Valley is distant from the Sea-coast, and my
instruction was not to leaue the Coast, I determined to leaue the
discouery thereof vntill my returne; at which time I might doe
it more commodiously.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Vacupa a town 40. leagues from the Bay of
California.</span>
Thus I trauelled three dayes iourney through townes inhabited
by the sayde people, of whome I was receiued as I was of those
which I had passed, and came vnto a Towne of reasonable
bignesse, called Vacupa, where they shewed mee
great courtesies, and gaue mee great store of good
victuals, because the soyle is very fruitfull, and may
bee watered. This Towne is fortie leagues distant
from the Sea. And because I was so farre from the Sea, it being
two dayes before Passion Sunday, I determined to stay there vntill
Easter, to informe my selfe of the Islandes, whereof I sayde before
that I had information. And so I sent certaine Indians to the
Sea by three seuerall wayes, whom I commanded to bring mee
some Indians of the Sea-coast, and of some of those Islandes, that
<!--067.png-->
<span class="pagenum">70</span>
I might receiue information of them: and I sent Stephan Dorantez
the Negro another way, whom I commanded to goe directly
Northward fiftie or threescore leagues, to see if by that way hee
might learne any newes of any notable thing which wee sought
to discouer, and I agreed with him, that if hee found any knowledge
of any peopled and riche Countrey which were of great
importance, that hee should goe no further, but should returne
in person, or should sende mee certaine Indians with that token
which wee were agreed vpon, to wit, that if it were but a meane
thing, hee should sende mee a white Crosse of one handfull long;
and if it were any great matter, one of two handfuls long; and
if it were a Countrey greater and better then Nueua Espanna, hee
should send mee a great crosse. So the sayde Stephan departed
from mee on Passion-sunday after dinner: and within foure dayes
after the messengers of Stephan returned vnto me with a great
Crosse as high as a man, and they brought me word from Stephan,
that I should forthwith come away after him, for hee had found
people which gaue him information of a very mighty Prouince,
and that he had certaine Indians in his company, which had bene
in the sayd Prouince, and that he had sent me one of the said
Indians.
<span class="sidenote">From Vacupa to Ceuola are 32. dayes
iourney.</span>
This Indian told me, that it was thirtie
dayes iourney from the Towne where Stephan was,
vnto the first Citie of the sayde Prouince, which is
called Ceuola. Hee affirmed also, that there are seuen
great Cities in this Prouince, all vnder one Lord, the
houses whereof are made of Lyme and Stone, and are very great,
and the least of them with one lofte aboue head, and some of
two and of three loftes, and the house of the Lorde of the
Prouince of foure, and that all of them ioyne one vnto the other
in good order, and that in the gates of the principall houses
there are many Turques-stones cunningly wrought, whereof hee
sayth they haue there great plentie: also that the people of this
Citie goe very well apparelled: and that beyond this there are
other Prouinces, all which (hee sayth) are much greater then
these seuen cities. I gaue credite to his speach, because I found
him to bee a man of good vnderstanding: but I deferred my
departure to follow Stephan Dorantes, both because I thought hee
would stay for mee, and also to attend the returne of my messengers
which I had sent vnto the Sea, who returned vnto me
vpon Easter day, bringing with them certaine inhabitants of the
Sea-coast, and of two of the Islands. Of whom I vnderstoode,
<!--068.png--><span class="pagenum">71</span>
<span class="sidenote">Great pearles and much gold in the Isles of
California, which are 34. in number.</span>
that the Islandes aboue mentioned were scarce of victuals, as I
had learned before, and that they are inhabited by
people, which weare shelles of Pearles vpon their
foreheads, and they say that they haue great Pearles,
and much Golde. They informed mee of foure and
thirtie Islandes, lying one neere vnto another: they
say that the people on the Sea-coast haue small store
of victuals, as also those of the Islandes, and that they traffique
one with the other vpon raftes. This coast stretcheth Northward
as is to bee seene. These Indians of the Coast brought me
certaine Targets made of Cow-hydes very well dressed, which
were so large, that they couered them from the head to the very
foote, with a hole in the toppe of the same to looke out before:
they are so strong that a Crossebow (as I suppose) will not pierce
them.</p>

<div class="c3"><a id="Chap_2"></a>Chap. 2.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">He hath new information of the seuen Cities by certain Indians
called Pintados, and of three other kingdomes called
Marata, Acus, and Totonteac, being Countreys very rich
in Turqueses and Hides of cattel. Following his voyage
through those countries, he taketh possession thereof for
the Emperors Maiestie, and of the Indians is much
honoured and serued with victuals.</div>

<p>The same day came three Indians of those which I called
Pintados, because I saw their faces, breasts and armes painted.
These dwel farther vp into the countrey towards the East, and
some of them border vpon the seuen cities, which sayd they came
to see mee, because they had heard of me: and among other
things, they gaue me information of the seuen cities, and of the
other Prouinces, which the Indian that Stephan sent me had tolde
me of, almost in the very same manner that Stephan had sent
mee worde; and so I sent backe the people of the sea-coast; and
two Indians of the Islandes sayde they would goe with mee seuen
or eight dayes.</p>

<p>So with these and with the three Pintados aboue mentioned, I
departed from Vacupa vpon Easter Tuesday, the same way that
Stephan went, from whom I receiued new messengers with a
Crosse of the bignesse of the first which he sent me: which
hastened mee forward, and assured me that the land which I
<!--069.png-->
<span class="pagenum">72</span>
sought for, was the greatest and best countrey in all those partes.
The sayd messengers told mee particularly without fayling in any
one poynt, all that which the first messenger had tolde mee, and
much more, and gaue mee more plaine information thereof. So I
trauelled that day being Easter Tuesday, and two dayes more, the
very same way that Stephan had gone; at the end of which 3
dayes they tolde mee, that from that place a man might trauell
in thirtie dayes to the citie of Ceuola, which is the first of the
seuen. Neither did one onely tell me thus much, but very many;
who tolde me very particularly of the greatnesse of the houses,
and of the fashion of them, as the first messengers had informed
me. Also they tolde me, that besides these seuen Cities, there are
3 other kingdomes which are called Marata, Acus, and Totonteac.
I enquired of them wherefore they trauelled so farre from their
houses: They said that they went for Turqueses and Hides of
kine, and other things; and that of all these there was great
abundance in this Countrey. Likewise I enquired how, and
by what meanes they obteined these things: They tolde me, by
their seruice, and by the sweat of their browes, and that they went
vnto the first citie of the Prouince which is called Ceuola, and
that they serued them in tilling their ground, and in other
businesses, and that they giue them Hydes of oxen, which they
haue in those places, and turqueses for their seruice, and that the
people of this city weare very fine and excellent turqueses
hanging at their eares and at their nostrils. They say
also, that of these turqueses they make fine workes vpon the
principall gates of the houses of this citie. They tolde mee,
that the apparell which the inhabitants of Ceuola weare, is a
gowne of cotten downe to the foote, with a button at the necke,
and a long string hanging downe at the same, and that the sleeues
of these gownes are as broad beneath as aboue. They say, they
gyrd themselues with gyrdles of turqueses, and that ouer these
coates some weare good apparel, others hides of kine very well
dressed, which they take to bee the best apparel of that countrey,
whereof they haue there great quantitie. Likewise the women
goe apparelled, and couered downe to the foote. These Indians
gaue me very good intertainment, and curiously enquired the day
of my departure from Vacupa, that at my returne they might
prouide me of foode and lodging. They brought certaine sicke
folkes before mee, that I might heale them, and sought to touch
my apparell, and gaue mee certaine Cow-hydes so well trimmed
<!--070.png-->
<span class="pagenum">73</span>
and dressed, that by them a man might coniecture that they were
wrought by ciuile people, and all of them affirmed, that they came
from Ceuola.</p>

<p>The next day I followed my journey, and carrying with mee
the Pintados, I came to another Village where I was well receiued
by the people of the same: who likewise sought to touch my
garments, and gaue mee as particular knowledge of the Lande
aforesayde, as I had receiued of those which mette mee before:
and also tolde mee, that from that place certaine people were
gone with Stephan Dorantez, fours or fiue dies journey. And
here I found a great crosse, which Stephan had left me for a signe,
that the newes of the good Countrey increased, and left worde,
that with all haste they should sende mee away, and that hee
would stay for mee at the ende of the first Desert that he mette
with. Heere I set vp two Crosses, and tooke possession according
to mine instruction, because that the Countrey seemed better
vnto mee then that which I had passed, and that I thought it
meete to make an acte of possession as farre as that place.</p>

<p>In this maner I trauailed fiue dayes alwayes finding inhabited
places with great hospitalitie and intertainments, and many Turqueses,
and Oxe-hides, and the like report concerning the
countrey. Heere I vnderstood, that after two dayes iourney I
should finde a desert where there is no foode; but that there
were certaine gone before to build mee lodgings, and to carrie
foode for mee: whereupon I hastened my way, hoping to finde
Stephan at the ende thereof, because in that place hee had left
worde that he would stay for mee. Before I came to the desert,
I mette with a very pleasant Towne, by reason of great store of
waters conueighed thither to water the same. Heere I mette
with many people both men and women clothed in Cotton, and
some couered with Oxe-hydes, which generally they take for
better apparell then that of cotton. All the people of this
Village goe in Caconados, that is to say, with Turqueses hanging
at their nostrilles and eares: which Turqueses they call Cacona.
Amongst others the Lord of this Village came vnto me, and two
of his brethren very well apparelled in Cotton, who also were in
Caconados, each of them hauing his Collar of Turqueses about his
necke: and they presented vnto mee many wilde beastes, as
Conies, Quailes, Maiz, nuttes of Pine trees, and all in
great abundance, and offered mee many Turqueses and dressed
Oxe-hydes and very fayre vessels to drinke in, and other things:
<!--071.png-->
<span class="pagenum">74</span>
whereof I would receiue no whit.
<span class="sidenote">Store of woollen cloth and sheepe in
Totonteac.</span>
And hauing my garment of
gray cloth, which in Spaine is called &ccedil;arago&ccedil;a, the Lord of this
Village, and the other Indians touched my gowne
with their handes, and tolde mee, that of such Cloth
there was great store in Totonteac, and that the people
of that Countrey wore the same. Whereat I laughed,
and sayde that it was nothing else but such apparell of Cotton as
they wore. And they replyed: We would haue thee thinke that
we vnderstand, that apparell which thou wearest, and that which
we weare are of diuers sortes. Vnderstand thou, that in Ceuola
all the houses are full of that apparell which we weare, but in
Totonteac there are certaine litle beasts, from whom they take
that thing wherewith such apparell as thou wearest, is made. I
prayed them to informe mee more playnely of this matter. And
they tolde me that the sayde beastes were about the bignesse of
the two braches or spaniels which Stephan carryed with him, and
they say that there is great store of that cattell in Totonteac.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A desert of foure dayes iourney.</span>
The next day I entred into the Desert, and where I was to
dine, I found bowers made, and victuals in abundance
by a riuers side; and at night I found bowers and
victuals in like sort, and after that maner I found for
4 dayes trauell: all which time the wildernesse continueth.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A very populous valley.</span>
At the ende of these foure dayes, I entered into a
valley very well inhabited with people. At the first
Village there mette me many men and women with
victuals, and all of them had Turqueses hanging at their nostrils
and eares, and some had collars of turqueses like those which the
Lord of the Village before I came to the Desert, and his two
<!--072.png--><span class="pagenum">75</span>
<span class="sidenote">Collars of turqueses two or three times

brethren wore: sauing that they ware them but
single about their neckes, and these people weare
them three or foure times double, and goe in good
apparell, and skinnes or Oxen: and the women weare
of the sayd Turqueses at there nostrils and ears, and very good
wast-coats and other garments. Heere there was a great knowledge
of Ceuola, as in Nueua Espanna of Temistitan, and in Peru
of Cuzco: and they tolde vs particularly the maner of their
houses, lodgings, streetes and market-places, as men that had bene
oftentimes there, and as those which were furnished from thence
with things necessary for the seruice of their housholde, as those
also had done, which I already had passed. I tolde them it was
impossible that the houses should be made in such sort as they
informed mee, and they for my better vnderstanding tooke earth
or ashes, and powred water thereupon, and shewed me how they
layd stones vpon it, and how the buylding grew vp, as they
continued laying stones thereon, vntill it mounted aloft. I asked
them whether the men of that Countrey had wings to mount vp
vnto those loftes: whereat they laughed, and shewed mee a
Ladder in as good sort as I my selfe was able to describe it.
Then they tooke a Staffe and helde it ouer their heads, and said
that the lofts were so high one aboue another. Likewise heere
I had information of the woollen cloth of Totonteac, where
they say are houses like those of Ceuola, and better and more in
number, and that it is a great Prouince, and hath no gouernour.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">This graduation is mistaken by 6. or 7. degrees at
the least.</span>
Here I vnderstand that the coast of the sea trended much toward
the West: for vnto the entrance of this first
desert which I passed, the coast still stretched Northward:
and because the trending of the coast is a
thing of great importance, I was desirous to knowe
and see it: and I saw plainely, that in 35. degrees the
coast stretcheth to the West, whereat I reioyced no lesse then of
the good newes within land, and so I returned backe to proceede
in my iourney.</p>

<p>Through the foresayd valley I trauailed fiue dayes iourney
which is inhabited with goodly people, and so aboundeth
with victuals, that it sufficeth to feede aboue three thousand
horsemen: it is all well watered and like a garden: the
burroughs and townes are halfe and a quarter of a league
long, and in all these villages, I found very ample report of
Ceuola, whereof they made such particular relation vnto
<!--073.png-->
<span class="pagenum">76</span>
me, as people which goe yeerely thither to earne their
liuing. Heere I found a man borne in Ceuola, who
told me that he came thither, hauing escaped from the
gouernour or Lieutenant of the towne; for the Lord of these seuen
Cities liueth and abideth in one of those townes called Ahacus,
and in the rest he appoynteth lieu-tenants vnder him. This
townesman of Ceuola is a white man of a good complexion,
somewhat well in yeeres, and of farre greater capacitie then the
inhabitants of this valley, or then those which I had left behind
me. Hee sayde that he would goe with mee, that I might begge
his pardon: and of him I learned many particulars: he tolde me
that Ceuola was a great Citie, inhabited with great store of people,
and hauing many Streetes and Market-places: and that in some
partes of this Citie there are certaine very great houses of fiue
stories high, wherein the chiefe of the Citie assemble themselues
at certaine dayes of the yeere. He sayeth that the houses are of
Lyme and Stone, according as others had tolde mee before, and
that the gates, and small pillars of the principall houses are of
Turqueses, and all the vessels wherein they are serued, and the
other ornaments of their houses were of golde: and that the other
sixe Cities are built like vnto this, whereof some are bigger: and
that Ahacus is the chiefest of them.
<span class="sidenote">Marata lieth toward the Southeast.</span>
Hee sayth that toward the Southeast there is a kingdome called
Marata, and that there were woont to be many, and
those great Cities, which were all built of houses of Stone, with
diuers lofts: and that these haue and doe wage warre with the
Lord of the seuen cities, through which warre this kingdome of
Marata is for the most part wasted, although it yet continueth
and mainteineth warre against the other.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Totonteac lyeth West.</span>
Likewise he saith, that the kingdome called Totonteac lyeth
toward the West, which he saith is a very mightie
Prouince, replenished with infinite store of people
and riches: and that in the sayde Kingdome they
weare woollen cloth like that which I weare, and other finer
sorts of woollen cloth made of the fleeces of those beastes which
they described before vnto me: and that they are a very ciuile
people. Moreouer hee tolde me, that there is another great
Prouince and kingdome called Acus; for there is Acus, and
Ahacus with an aspiration, which is the principall of the seuen
cities: and Acus without an aspiration is a kingdome and Prouince
of it selfe. He told me also, that the apparel which they weare
<!--074.png-->
<span class="pagenum">77</span>
in Ceuola is after the same maner as they before had certified me,
and that all the inhabitants of the Citie lie vpon beddes raysed a
good height from the ground, with quilts and canopies ouer them,
which couer the sayde Beds: and hee tolde mee that he would
goe with me to Ceuola and farther also, if I would take him with
me. The like relation was giuen vnto me in this towne by many
others, but not so particularly. I trauelled three dayes iourney
through this valley: the inhabitants whereof made mee exceeding
great cheere and intertainement. In this valley I saw aboue a
thousand Oxe-hides most excellently trimmed and dressed. And
here also I saw farre greater store of Turqueses and chaines made
thereof, then in all places which I had passed; and they say, that
all commeth from the city of Ceuola, whereof they haue great
knowledge, as also of the kingdome of Marata, and of the kingdomes
of Acus and Totonteac.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 4.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Of a very great beast with one horne vpon his forehead; and of
the courtesies which the Indians shewed Frier Marcus of
Ni&ccedil;a, in his Voyage. Also how cruelly Stephan Dorantez
and his companions were vsed vpon their arriuall at
Ceuola, by the Lorde thereof.</div>

<p>Here they shewed me an hide halfe as bigge againe as the hide
of a great oxe, and tolde me that it was the skin of a beast which
had but one horne vpon his forehead, and that this horne bendeth
toward his breast, and that out of the same goeth a point right
forward, wherein he hath so great strength, that it will breake any
thing how strong so euer it be, if he runne against it, and that
there are great store of these beasts in that Countrey. The
colour of the hide is of the colour of a great Goat-skin, and the
haire is a finger thicke. Here I had messengers from Stephan
which brought me word, that by this time he was come to the
farthest part of the desert, and that he was very ioyfull, because
the farther he went, the more perfect knowledge he had of the
greatnesse of the countrey, and sent me word, that since his
departure from me, hee neuer had found the Indians, in any lye;
for euen vnto that very place he had found al in such maner as
they had informed him, and hoped that he should find the like at
his arriuall in the valley which he was going vnto, as he had found
<!--075.png-->
<span class="pagenum">78</span>
in the villages before passed. I set vp crosses, and vsed those acts
and ceremonies, which were to be done according to my instructions.
<span class="sidenote">Fifteene daies iourney from the end of the desert
to Ceuola or Ciuola.</span>
The inhabitants requested me to stay here three or foure
daies, because that from this place there were foure dayes iourney
vnto the desert, and from the first entrance in the
same desert vnto the citie of Ceuola are 15 great dayes
iourney more: also that they would prouide victuals
for me and other necessaries for that voyage. Likewise
they told me, that with Stephan the Negro were
gone aboue 300 men to beare him company, and to carry victuals
after him, and that in like sort many of them would go with me to
serue me, because they hoped to returne home rich. I thanked
them, and willed them to set things in order with speede, and so
I rested there three dayes, wherein I alwayes informed my selfe
of Ceuola, and of as many other things as I could learne, and
called many Indians vnto me, and examined them seuerally, and
all of them agreed in one tale, and told me of the great multitude
of people, and of the order of the streetes, of the greatnesse of the
houses, and of the strength of the gates, agreeing altogether with
that which the rest before had told me. After three dayes many
assembled themselues to goe with me, 30 of the principal of whom
I tooke, being very well apparelled, and with chaines of turqueses,
which some of them weare fiue or sixe times double, and other
people to cary things necessary for them and me, and so set
forward on my voyage.</p>

<p>Thus I entred into the second desert on the 9 of May, and
trauelled the first day by a very broad and beaten way, and we
came to diner vnto a water, where the Indians had made prouision
for me: and at night we came to another water, where I found a
house which they had fully made vp for me, and another house
stood made where Stephan lodged when he passed that way, and
many old cottages and many signes of fire which the people had
made that trauelled to Ceuola by this way. In this sort I
trauelled 12 dayes iourney being alway well prouided of victuals,
of wild beasts, Hares, and Partridges of the same colour and tast
with those of Spaine although they are not so big, for they be
somewhat lesse.</p>

<p>Here met vs an Indian the sonne of one of the chiefe men that
accompanied mee, which had gone before with Stephan, who
came in a great fright, hauing his face and body all couered with
sweat, and shewing exceeding sadnesse in his countenance; and
<!--076.png-->
<span class="pagenum">79</span>
he told mee that a dayes iourney before Stephan came to Ceuola
he sent his great Mace made of a gourd by his messengers, as he
was alwayes woont to send them before him, that hee might knowe
in what sort hee came vnto them, which gourd had a string of
belles vpon it, and two feathers one white and another red, in
token that he demanded safe conduct, and that he came peaceably.
And when they came to Ceuola before the Magistrate, which the
Lord of the citie had placed there for his Lieutenant, they deliuered
him the sayde great gourd, who tooke the same in his hands, and
after he had spyed the belles, in a great rage and fury hee cast it
to the ground, and willed the messengers to get them packing
with speed, for he knew well ynough what people they were, and
that they should will them in no case to enter into the citie, for
if they did hee would put them all to death. The messengers
returned and tolde Stephan how things had passed, who answered
them, that it made no great matter, and would needes proceed on
his voyage till he came to the citie of Ceuola: where he found
men that would not let him enter into the towne, but shut him
into a great house which stoode without the citie, and streightway
tooke all things from him which hee caried to truck and barter
with them, and certaine turqueses, and other things which he had
receiued of the Indians by the way, and they kept him there all
that night without giuing him meate or drinke, and the next day
in the morning this Indian was a thirst, and went out of the house
to drinke at a riuer that was neere at hand, and within a little
while after he saw Stephan running away, and the people followed
him, and slew certaine of the Indians which went in his company.
And when this Indian saw these things, he hid himselfe on the
banks of the riuer, and afterward crossed the high way of the
desert. The Indians that went with me hearing these newes
began incontinently to lament, and I thought these heauie and
bad newes would cost mee my life, neither did I feare so much
the losse of mine owne life, as that I should not bee able to returne
to giue information of the greatnesse of that Countrey, where our
Lord God might be glorified: but streightway I cut the cords of
my budgets which I carried with me ful of merchandise for
traffique, which I would not doe till then, nor giue any thing to
any man, and began to diuide all that I carried with mee among
the principall men, willing them not to be afraid, but to goe
forward with me, and so they did. And going on our way, within
a dayes iourney of Ceuola wee met two other Indians of those
<!--077.png-->
<span class="pagenum">80</span>
which went with Stephan, which were bloody and wounded in
many places: and assoone as they came to vs, they which were
with mee began to make great lamentation. These wounded
Indians I asked for Stephan, and they aggreeing in all poynts with
the first Indian sayd, that after they had put him into the foresayd
great house without giuing him meat and drinke all that day and
all that night, they tooke from Stephan all the things which hee
carried with him. The next day when the Sunne was lance high,
Stephan went out of the house, and some of the chiefe men with
him, and suddenly came store of people from the citie, whom
assoone as hee sawe he began to run away, and we likewise, and
foorthwith they shot at vs and wounded vs, and certaine dead
men fell vpon vs, and so we lay till night and durst not stirre,
and we heard great rumours in the citie, and saw many men and
women keeping watch and ward vpon the walles thereof, and
after this we could not see Stephan any more, and wee thinke
they haue shot him to death, as they haue done all the rest which
went with him, so that none are escaped but we onely.</p>

and how after his departure from thence being preserued
by God in so dangerous a voyage, he arriued at Compostella
in Nueua Galicia.</div>

<p>Hauing considered the former report of the Indians, and the
euill meanes which I had to prosecute my voyage as I desired, I
thought it not good wilfully to lose my life as Stephan did; and
so I told them, that God would punish those of Ceuola, and that
the Viceroy when he should vnderstand what had happened,
would send many Christians to chastise them: but they would
not beleeue me, for they sayde that no man was able to withstand
the power of Ceuola. And herewithall I left them, and went
aside two or three stones cast, and when I returned I found an
Indian of mine which I had brought from Mexico called Marcus,
who wept and sayde vnto me: Father, these men haue consulted
to kill vs, for they say, that through your and Stephans meanes
their fathers are slaine, and that neither man nor woman of them
<!--078.png-->
<span class="pagenum">81</span>
shall remaine vnslaine. Then againe I diuided among them
certaine other things which I had, to appease them, whereupon
they were somewhat pacified, albeit they still shewed great griefe
for the people which were slaine. I requested some of them to goe
to Ceuola to see if any other Indian were escaped, with intent that
they might learne some newes of Stephan; which I could not obtaine
at their handes. When I saw this, I sayd vnto them, that I purposed
to see the citie of Ceuola, whatsoeuer came of it. They sayde
that none of them would goe with me. At the last when they sawe
mee resolute, two of the chiefe of them sayde they would goe
with me: with whome and with mine Indians and interpreters
I followed my way, till I came within sight of Ceuola, which is
situate on a plaine at the foote of a round hill, and maketh shew
to bee a faire citie, and is better seated than any that I haue seene
in these partes. The houses are builded in order, according as
the Indians told me, all made of stone with diuers stories, and
flatte roofes, as farre as I could discerne from a mountaine,
whither I ascended to viewe the citie. The people are somewhat
white, they weare apparell, and lie in beds, their weapons are
bowes, they have Emralds and other jewels, although they esteeme
none so much as turqueses, wherewith they adorn the walles of
the porches of their houses, and their apparell and vessels, and
they vse them in stead of money through all the Countrey.
Their apparell is of cotton and of ox hides, and this is their most
commendable and honourable apparell.
<span class="sidenote">Most rich mines of gold and siluer in the prouince
of the Pintados.</span>
They vse vessels of gold
and siluer, for they haue no other metall, whereof there is greater
vse and more abundance then in Peru, and they buy
the same for turqueses in the prouince of the Pintados,
where there are sayd to be mines of great
abundance. Of other kingdomes I could not obtaine
so particular instruction. Diuers times I was tempted
to goe thither, because I knewe I could but hazard my life, and
that I had offered vnto God the first day that I began my iourney:
in the ende I began to bee afraid, considering in what danger I
should put my selfe, and that if I should dye, the knowledge of
this countrey should be lost, which in my iudgement is the
greatest and the best that hitherto hath been discouered:
and when I told the chiefe men, what a goodly citie
Ceuola seemed vnto mee, they answered me that it was
the least of the seuen cities, and that Totonteac
<!--079.png--><span class="pagenum">82</span>
<span class="sidenote">Totonteac the greatest and most populous
prouince.</span>
is the greatest and best of them all, because it hath
so many houses and people, that there is no ende of
them. Hauing seene the disposition and situation of
the place, I thought good to name that Countrey El
Nueuo reyno de san Francisco: in which place I made a great
heape of stones by the helpe of the Indians, and on the toppe
thereof I set vp a small slender crosse because I wanted meanes
to make a greater, and sayd that I set vp that crosse and heape in
the name of the most honourable Lord Don Antonio de Mendo&ccedil;a
Viceroy and Captaine generall of Nueua Espanna, for the
Emperour our Lord, in token of possession, according to mine
instruction. Which possession I sayd that I tooke in that place
of all the seuen cities, and of the kingdomes of Totonteac, of
Acus, and of Marata. Thus I returned with much more feare
then victuals, and went vntill I found the people which I had
left behind mee, with all the speede that I could make, whome I
ouertooke in two dayes trauell, and went in their company till I
had passed the desert, where I was not made so much of as
before: for both men and women made great lamentation for the
people which were slaine at Ceuola, and with feare I hastened
from the people of this valley, and trauelled tenne leagues the
first day, and so I went daily eight or ten leagues, without staying
vntill I had passed the second desert. And though I were in
feare, yet I determined to go to the great plaine, wherof I said
before, that I had information, being situate at the foote of the
mountaines, and in that place I vnderstoode that this plaine is
inhabited for many dayes iourney toward the East, but I durst
not enter into it, considering, that if hereafter wee shoulde
inhabite this other Countrey of the seuen cities, and the
kingdomes before mentioned, that then I might better discouer
the same, without putting my selfe in hazard, and leaue
it for this time, that I might giue relation of the things which
I had now seene. At the entrance of this plaine I saw but
seuen Townes onely of a reasonable bignesse, which were a farre
off in a low valley beeing very greene and a most fruitfull soyle,
out of which ranne many Riuers. I was informed that there was
much golde in this valley, and that the inhabitants worke it into
vessels and thinne plates, wherewith they strike and take off their
sweat, and that they are people that will not suffer those of the
other side of the plaine to traffique with them, and they could
not tell me the cause thereof. Here I set vp two crosses, and
<!--080.png-->
<span class="pagenum">83</span>
tooke possession of the plaine and valley in like sort and order, as
I did at other places before mentioned.
<span class="sidenote">Compostella in 21. degrees of latitude.</span>
And from thence I
returned on my voyage with as much haste as I coulde make,
vntill I came to the citie of Saint Michael in the prouince of
Culiacan, thinking there to have found Francis Vazquez de
Coronado gouernour of Nueua Galicia, and finding him not there,
I proceeded on my iourney till I came to the Citie of
Compostella, where I found him. I write not here
many other particularities, because they are impertinent
to this matter: I only report that which
I haue seene, and which was told me concerning the Countreys

La
substancia dello es, que el anno de mil y quinientos
y ochenta y vno, teniendo noticia vn
Religioso de la Orden de sant Francisco, que se
llamaua fray Augustin Ruyz, que moraua en el
valle de sant Bartholome, por relation de ciertos
Indios. Conchos que se comunicauan con otros
sus conuezinos llamados Passaguates: que hazia
la parte del Norte (caminando siempre por tierra)
auia ciertas poblaciones grandes, y nunca sabidas
de nuestros Espannoles, ni descubiertas, con zelo
de caridad, y de saluacion de las almas, pidio
licencia al Conde de Corunna Viery de la dicha
Nueua Espanna, y a sus mayores, para yr a ellas,
a procurar aprendar su lengua, y sabida, bautizarlos,
y predicarles el santo Euangelio.

la licencia de los sobredichos, tomando otros dos
companneros de su mesma. Orden, se partio con
ocho soldados, que de voluntad le quisieron
acompannar, a poner en execution su Christiano
y zeloso intento. Los quales a pocos dias de
camino toparon con vna Prouincia, que se
llamaua de los Tiguas, distante de las minas de
sancta Barbora (de donde comen&ccedil;aron la jornoda)
dozientas y cinquenta leguas hazia el Norte,
en la qual por cierta occasion los naturales le
mataron al dicho padre vno de sus dos companeros.
El qual, los soldados que yuan com el,
viendo, y sintiendo el successo, y temiendo que
del se podria seguir otro mayor danno, acordaron
de comun consentimiento de boluerse a las minas
de donde auian salido, con consideracion de que
la gente que yua era muy poca para resistir a los
successos que se podian offrecer en tanta distancia
de la viuienda de los Espannoles, y tan lexos del
necessario socorro. Los dos Religiosos que
hauian quedado, no solo no vinieron en su
parecer, mas antes viendo la ocasion para poner
en execucion su buen desseo, y tanta mies madura
para la mesa de Dios, viendo quo no podian persuadir
a los soldados a passar adelante en el
descubrimiento, se quedaron ellos en la dicha
Prouincia con tres muchachos Indios, y vn mestizo,
que auian lleuado consigo, pareciendoles que
aunque quedassan solos, estauan alli seguros, por
la affabilidad y amor con que los naturales della
los tratauan.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The mines of Barbora 160 leagues from

Llegados los ocho soldades adonde

dista de las dichas minas de santa Barbora ciento
y sesenta leguas. Sintieron mucho los religiosos
de sant Francisco la quedada de sus hermanos: y
timiendo no los matassen viendo los solos, comen&ccedil;aron
a mouer los animos de algunos soldados,
para que en compannia de otro Religioso de la
mesma Orden llamado fray Bernardino Beltran,
tornassen &agrave; la dicha Prouincia, a sacar de peligro
a los dichos dos Religiosos, y proseguir con la
empresa comen&ccedil;ada.</p>

la maiestad del Rey Don Philippe nuestro sennor,
natural de Cordoua. El qual como enteniesse el
desseo delos dichos religiosos, y la importancia
del negocio, se offrecio a la jornada y a gastar en
ella parte de su hazienda, y a riesgar su vida,
siendo le para ello concedida licencia de alguna
persona que representasse a su maiestad, la qual
procurandola los dichos religiosos, le fue dada por

Tienen mucho maiz, que es el trigo de las Indias

muchos rios que crian mucha cantidad de pescado
muy bueno, y de diuersas suertes: andan casi
todos desnudos, y las armas que vsan son arco y

Caciques, como los Mexicanos, y no les hallaron
Idolos, ni pudieron entender que adorassen &agrave;

<span class="pagenum">87</span>
muy contentos con ellas, despues de auersido
informados de los nuestros dela significacion

por cuyo medio supieron de otras poblaciones,
para adonde los dichos Conchos los guiaron,
accompannandolos mas de veinte y quatro leguas,

y los salian a recebir de paz, por auiso que
embiauan los Caciques de vnos pueblos a otros.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Passaguates.</i></span>
Andadas las veinte y quatro leguas dichas,
toparon otra nacion de Indios, llamados Passaguates,
los quales viuian al modo que los ya

<span class="sidenote"><i>Silver.</i></span>
Conchos sus conuezinos, y hizieron con ellos

camino muchas minas de plata, al parecer de los
que lo entendian, de mucho, y muy rico metal.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Tobosos.</i></span>
Vna jornada destas toparon otra nacion, llamada
los Tobosos, los quales en viendo el rastro de los

algunos annos antes auian acudido por alli ciertos
soldados que yuan en busca de minas, y auian
lleuado cautiuos a ciertos naturales, lo qual tenia
temerosos y abispados a los demas. El Capitan
dio orden como los fuessen a llamar, assegurandolos
de que no los seria hecho ningun mal, y
diose tan buena manea que hizo venir a muchos,

tienen todos los hombres y mugeres los rostros
rayados, y los bra&ccedil;os, y piernas: es gente corpulenta,
y de mas policia, que los que hasta alli
auian visto, y tenian muchos mantenimientos, y
mucha ca&ccedil;a de pie y de buelo, y gran cantitad de
pescado, a causa de tener grandes rios que vienen
de hazia el Norte, y alguno tan grande como
Guadalquiuir, el qual entra en la propria mar del
Norte.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Good salt.</i></span>
Tiene muchas lagunas de agur salida que
se quaja cierto tiempo del anno, y se haze muy
buena sal. Es gente bellicosa, y mostraronlo luego,
porque la primera noche que los nuestros assentaron
real, les flecharon, y mataron cinco cauallos,
hiriendo muy mal otros tantos, y no dexaran
ninguno a vida, sino por las guardas que los defendieron.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Rio Grande. Twelve days journey.</i></span>
Hecho este mal racado, despoblaron

interprete llamado Pedro, Indio de su mesma
nacion, y con buenas razones los quieto y dexo de
paz, haziendolos baxar a su pueblo y casas, y
persuadiendolos a que diestien auiso asus vezinos
de que no eran hombres que hazian mal a nadie,
ni les yuan a tomar sus haziendas: que lo alcan&ccedil;o
facilmente con su prudencia, y con darles a los
Caciques algunas sartas de quentas de vidrio que
llenaua para este effeto, y sombreros, y otras
ninnerias: con este, y con el buen tratamiento
que les hazian, se fueron muchos dellos en compannia
de los nuestros algunos dias, caminando
siempre por la ribera del rio grande arriba dicho,
portoda la qual hauia muchos pueblos di Indios
desta nacion, que duraron por espacio de doze
jornadas, en todas las quales auisados los vnos
Caciques de los otros salian a recebir a los
nuestros sin arcos, ni flechas, y les trayan muchos
mantenimientos, y otros regalos y dadiuos, en
especial cueros y camu&ccedil;as muy bien adere&ccedil;ados,
y que no les excedian en esto las de Flandes.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Apalito</i>.</span>

sennalauan a Dios mirando al cielo, y le llaman
en sul lengua Apalito, y le conocen por sennor,
de cuya larga mano, y misericordia confiessan
auer recibido la vida, y el ser natural, y los bienes
temporales. Venian muchos dellos y les mugeres
y ninnos, a que el Religioso, que diximos que yua
con el dicho Capitan y soldados, los santiguasse,
y echasse la benedicion: el qual como les preguntasse
de quien auian entendido aquel conocimiento
de Dios que tenian: respondieron, que de
tres Christianos, y vn negro, que auian passado
por alli, y detenidose algunos dias en su tierra,
que segun las sennas que dieron, eran Aluar
Nunnes Cabe&ccedil;a de Vaca, y Dorantes, y Castillo
Maldonado, y vn negro, que todos ellos auian
escapado de la armida con que entro Panfilo de
Narbaez en la Florida, y despues de auer sido
muchos dias esclauos, vinieron a dar a estos
pueblos, haziendo Dios por medio dellos muchos
milagros, y sanando con el tocamento solo de sus
manos muchos infermos, por lo qual dexaron gran
nombre en toda aquella tierra. Toda esta
Prouincia quedo de paz, y muy sossegada, en cuya
demonstracion fueron acompannando y siruiendo
a los nuestros algunos dias por la orilla del rio que
diximos arriba.</p>

<p>A pocas dias toparon con vna gran poblacion
de Indios, adonde los salieron a recebir por
nueua que tuuieron de sus vezinos, y les sacaron
muchas cosas muy curiosas de pluma de differentes
colores, y muchas mantas de algodon barretadas
de azul y blanco, como las que traen de la China,
para rescatarlas, y trocarlas por otras cosas.
Yuan todos, assi hombres como mugeres, y ninnos
vestidos de camu&ccedil;as muy buenas y bien adobadas,
y nancapudieron los nuestros entender que nacion
era por falta de interprete que intendiesse su
lengua, aunque por sennas tratauan con ellos, &agrave;
los quales como les mostrassen algunas piedras de
metal rico, y les preguntassen si hauiade aquello
en su tierra: Respondieron por las mesmas sennas
que cinco dias de comino de alli hazia el Poniente,
auia de aquello en muy gran cantidad, y que ellos
los guiarian para alla, y se lo mostrarian, como lo
cumplieron despues, acompannandolos por espacio

seguia por el mesmo rio arriba otra de mucha mas
gente que la de la passada, de quien fueron bien
recibidos, y regalados con muchos presentes especialmente
de pescado que hauia infinito,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Great lakes.</i></span>
a causa
de vnas lagunas grandes que cerca de alli hauia,
que lo crian en la abundancia dicha. Estuuieron
entre estos tres dias, en los quales de dia, y de
noche les hizieron muchos bayles a su modo, con
particular signification de algeria: no se supo
como se llamaua esta nacion por falta de interprete,
aunque entendieron que se extendia
mucho, y que era muy grande. Entre estos
hallaron vn Indio Concho de nacion, que les dixo,
y sennalo, que quinze iornadas de alli hazia el
Poniente hauia vna laguna muy ancha, y cerca
della muy grandes pueblos, y casas de tres y
quatro altos, y la gente bien vestida, y la tierra de
muchos bastimentos, el qual se offrecio de
lleuarlos alla, y holgaran los nuestros dello, y solo
lo dexaron de poner en effecto, pro proseguir el
intento con que auian comen&ccedil;ado la jornada, que
era yr al Norte a dar socorra a los Religiosos
arriba dichos.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Rich ores.</i></span>
En esta Prouincia lo que particularmente
notaron fue, que hauia muy buyen temple, y muy
ricas tierras, y mucha ca&ccedil;a de pie y buelo, y
muchos metales ricos, y otras cosas particulares,
y de prouecho.</p>

<p>Desta Prouincia fueron siguiendo su derrota
por espacio de quinze dias, sin topar en todos
ellos ninguna gente por entre grandes pinales de
pinnas y pinnones, como los de Castilla: al cabo
de los quales auiendo caminado a su parecer
ochenta leguas, toparon vna pequenna Rancheria,
o pueblo de poca gente, y en sus casas, que eran
pobres, y de paja, gran cantidad de cueros de
venados tan bien adere&ccedil;ados como los de Flandes,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Salt.</i></span>
y mucha sal blanca, y muy buena. Hizieronles
muy buen hospedaje dos dias que alli estuuieron,
despues delos quales los acompannaron como
doze leguas a vnas poblaciones grandes, caminando
siempre por el rio del Norte ya dicho,
hasta llegar a la tierra que llaman el Nueuo
Mexico. Estaua toda la ribera del dicho rio
llena de grandissimas alamedas de alamos blancos
<!--088.png-->
<span class="pagenum">91</span>
y en partes tomauan quatro leguas de ancho, y
ansi mesmo de muchos nogales, y parrales como
los de Castilla. Auiendo caminado dos dias por
estas alamedas y noguerales, toparon diez pueblos
que estauan assentados en la ribera del dicho rio
por ambas partes, sin otros que se mostrauan mas
desuiados, en los quales les parecio auia mucha
gente, y la que ellos vieron passauan en numero
de diez mil animas. En esta Prouincia los regalaron
mucho con recebimientos, y con lleuarlos a
sus pueblos, don de les dauan mucha comida, y
gallinas de la tierra, y otras cosas, y todo con
gran voluntad.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Houses of four stories.</i></span>
Aqui hallaron casas de quatro
altos, y bien edificadas, y con galanos aposentos,
y en las mas dellas auia estufas para tiempo de
inuierno.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Clothing of the Natives.</i></span>
Andauan vestidos de algodon, y de
cuero de venado, y el traje, assi de los hombres,
como de las mugeres, es al modo del de los Indios
del reyno de Mexico: y lo que les causo mas
estranneza, fue ver que todos ellos, y ellas
andauan cal&ccedil;ados con&ccedil;apatos y botas de buen
cuero con suelas de vaca, cosa que hazta alli nunca
la auian visto. Las mugeres trayan el cabello
muy peynado, y compuesto, y sin cosa sobre la
cabe&ccedil;a. En todos estos pueblos auia Caciques
que los gouernauan como entre los Indios Mexicanos,
con Alguaziles para executar sus mandamientos,
los quales van por el pueblo, diziendo &agrave;
vozes la voluntad de los Caciques, y que la
pongan por obra.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Idols.</i></span>
En esta Prouincia hallaron los
nuestros muchos Idolos que adorauan, y en especial
que tenian en cada casa vn templo para el
Demonio, donde le lleuan de ordinario de
comer, y otra cosa, que de la manera que entre
los Christianos tenemos en los caminos cruzes:
assi tienen ellos vnas como capillas, altas, donde
dizen, descansa, y se recrea el Demonio, quando
va de vn pueblo a otro: las quales estan muy
adornadas y pintadas. En todas las sementeras,
o labran&ccedil;as, que las tienen muy grandes, tienen a
vn lado dellas vn portal con quatro pilares, donde
comen los trabajadores, y passan la siesta, porque
es la gente muy dada ala labor, y estan de ordinario
en ella: es tierra de muchos montes y
pinales.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Arms.</i></span>
Las armas que vsan son arcos muy fueres,

Despues de auer estado en esta Prouincia
quatro dias, y a poca distancia toparon con otra,
que se llamaua la Prouincia de los Tiguas, en la
qual auia diez y seys pueblos: en el vno de los
quales, llamado por nombre Poala, hallaron que
auian muerto los indios &agrave; los dichos dos padres
fray Francisco Lopez, y fray Augustin a quien
yuan a buscar, y juntamene a tres muchachos, y
vn mestizo. Quando los deste pueblo, y sus conuezinos
vieron a los nuestros, remordiendo les la
propria consciencia, y temiendose que yuan a
castigarlos, y tomar vengan&ccedil;a de las muertes de
los dichos padres, no los osaron esperar, antes
dexando sus casas deseirtas se subieron a las
sierras mas cercanas, de donde nunca los pudieron
hazer baxar, anunque lo procuraron con alagos y
mannas. Hallaron en los pueblos y casas muchos
mantenimientos, y gran infinidad de gallinas de
la tierra, y muchas suertes de metales, y algunos
que parecian muy buenos. No se pudo entender
claramente que tanta gente fuesse la desta Prouincia,
por causa de auerse (como ya dixe) subido
a la sierra.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote"><i>A debate.</i></span>
Auiendo hallado muertos a los que buscauan,
entraron en consulta sobre si se boluerian &agrave; la
Nueua Vizcaya, de donde hauian salido, o passarian
adelante: en lo qual vno diuersos pareceres:
pero como alli entendiessen, que a la parte de
Oriente de aquella Prouincia, y muy distante de
alli hauian grandes pueblos y ricos, hallandose
alli tan cerca, acordo el dicho Capitan Antonio
de Espejo de consentimiento de Religioso ya
dicho, llamado fray Bernardino Beltran, y de la
mayor parte de sus soldados, y companneros, de
proseguir con el descubrimiento hasta ver en que
paraua, para poder der dello noticia cierta y clara
<!--090.png-->
<span class="pagenum">93</span>
a su Magestad, como testigos de vista: y assi conformes
determinaron que quedandose alli el Real,
fuessen el Capitan con dos companneros en
demanda de su desseo, que lo pusieron por obra.
Y a dos dias de camino toparon con vna Prouincia
donde vieron onze pueblos, y en ellos mucha gente,
que a su parecer passaua en numero de quarenta
mil animas: era tierra muy fertil y bastecida,
cuyos confines estan immediatamente juntas con
las tierras de Cibola, donde ay muchas vacas, de
cuyos cueros se visten, y de algodon: siguiendo
en la manera del gouierno el orden que guarden
sus conuezinos: ay sennales de muchas minas
ricas, y assi hallauan metales dellas en algunas
casas de los Indios, los quales tienen, y adoran
Idolos: recibieronlos de paz, y dieron les de
comer. Visto esto, y la disposicion de la tierra,
se boluieron al real de donde auian salido, a dar
noticia a sus companneros de todo lo sobredicho.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Quires.</i></span>
Llegados al Real (como esta dicho) tuuieron
noticia de otra Prouincia, llamada los Quires, que
estaua el rio del Norte arriba seys leguas de
distancia, y como se partiessen para alla, y llegassen
vna legua della, les salieron a recebir de paz mucha
cantidad de Indios, y a rogar que se fuessen con
ellos a sus pueblos, que como lo hiziessen, fueron
muy bien recebidos y regalados. Vieron solamente
cinco pueblos en esta Prouincia, en los quales
auia muy gran cantidad de gente, y la que ellos
vieron passaua de quinze mil animas, y adoran
Idolos como sus vezinos. Hallaron en vno destos
pueblos vna Vrraca en vna jaula, como se
vsa en Castilla, y tira soles, como los que se traen
de la China, pintados en ellos el sol y la luna, y
muchas estrellas. Donde come tomassen la altura,
se hallaron en treynta y siete grados y medio
debaxo del Norte.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Cunames.</i></span>
Salieron desta Prouincia, y caminando por el
proprio rumbo, y a catorze leguas, hallaron otra
Prouincia, llamada los Cunames donde vieron
otros cinco pueblos, y el principal dellos,
<span class="sidenote"><i>City of Cia.</i></span>
y mas
grande se llamaua Cia, que era tan grande que
tenia ocho placas, cuyas casas eran encaladas, y

grandes, y en ellos a su entender mas de treynta
mil animas. Vno destos siete pueblos dixeron
era muy grande y hermoso, que la dexaron de yr

temor de algun ruyn successo, si a caso se diuidian
los vnos de los otros. Es gente al modo de la

teniendo otra entrada sino per vna escalera que
estaua hecha en la propria penna, cosa que admiro

<p>Vinieron los principales de paz a ver a los Espannoles,
y traxeron les muchas mantas, y camucas
muy bien adere cadas, y gran cantidad de

A la nueua de la riqueza dicha, quiso a cudir
el dicho Capitan Antonio de Espejo, y aunque
eran de su parecer algunos de sus companneros,
la mayor parte, y el Religioso fue de contrario:
diziendo, era ya tiempo de boluerse a la nueua
Viscaya de donde hauian salido, a dar cuenta de
lo que auian visto: que lo pusieron por obra
dentro de pocos dias la mayor parte, dexando al
Capitan con nueue companneros que le quisieron
seguir: el qual, despues de hauerse certificado
muy por entero de la riqueza arriba dicha, y de
mucha abundancia de metales que en ello auia
muy buenos, salio con los dichos sus companneros
desta prouincia, y caminando hazia el proprio
Poniente, despues de hauer andado veinte y ocho
leguas, hallaron otra muy grande en la qual les
parecio hauia mas de cinquenta mil animas,
<!--093.png-->
<span class="pagenum">96</span>
cuyos moradores como supiessen su llegada, les
embiaron vn recado, diziendo, que si no querian
que los matassen, no se acercassen mas a sus
pueblos; a lo qual respondio el dicho Capitan,
que ellos no les yuan a hazer mal, como lo verian,
y que assi les rogauan no se pusiessen en lleuar
adelante su intento, dando al mensajero algunas
cosas de las que lleuaua: el qual supo tan bien
obonar a los nuestros, y allanar los pechos alborotados
de los Indios, que les dieron lugar de
voluntad para que entrassen, que lo hizieron
con ciento y cinquenta Indios amigos de la
prouincia de Cibola ya dicha, y los tres
Indios Mexicanos, de quien queda hecha
mencion. Vna legua antes que llegassen
al primer pueblo, les salieron a recibir
mas de dos mil Indios cargados de bastimentos,
a quien el dicho Capitan dio algunas cosas de
poco precio, que a ellos les parecio ser de mucho,
y las estimaron masque si fueran de oro.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Zaguato or Ahuato</i>.</span>
Llegando
mas cerca del pueblo, que se llamaua Zaguato,
salio a recebirlos gran muche numbre de Indios,
y entre ellos los Caciques, haziendo tanta demostracion
de plazer y regozijo, que echauan mucha
farina de maiz por el suelo, para que la pisassen
los cauallos: con esta fiesta entraron en el, y
fueron muy bien hospedados, y regalados, que se
lo pago en parte el Capitan, con dar a todos los
mas principales sombreros, y quentas de vidrio, y
otras muchas cosas que lleuaua para semejantes
offrecimientos.</p>

<p>Despacharon luego los dichos Caciques recados
a todos los de aquella Prouincia, dandoles noticia
de la venida de los huespedes, y de como eran
hombres muy corteses, y no les hazian mal: lo
qual fue bastante para hazer los venir a todos
cargados de presentes para los nuestros, y de que
los importunassen, fuessen con ellos a holgarse a
sus pueblos, que lo hizieron, aunque siempre con
recado de lo que podia succeder. Por lo qual el
dicho Capitan vso de vna cautela, y fue dezir a
los Caciques, que por quanto los cauallos eran
muy brauos, y les auian dicho que los querian
matar, seria necessario hazer vn fuerte de calicanto
donde meter los para euitar el danno que querian
hazer en los Indios. Creyeronlo los Caciques
<!--094.png-->
<span class="pagenum">97</span>
tan de veras que dento de pocas horas juntaron
tanta gente que hizieron el dicho fuerte que los
nuestros querion con vna presteza increyble.
Demas desto, diziendo el Capitan que se queria
yr, le traxeron vn presente de 40. mil. mantas de
algodon pintadas y blancas, y mucha cantidad de
pannos de manos con borlas en las puntas, y otras
muchas cosas, y entre ellas metales ricos, y que
mostrauan tener mucha plata. Halaron entre
estos Indios muy gran noticia de la laguna grande
arriba dicha, y conformaron con los otros en lo
tocante a las riquezas, y mucha abundancia de oro.</p>

<p>Fiado el Capitan desta gente, y de sus buenos
animos, a cordo a cabo de algunos dias de dexar
alli cinco de sus companneros con los demas Indios
amigos, para que se boluiessen a la prouincia de
Zuny con el bagaje, y de yrse el con los quatro
que quedauan a la ligera en descubrimento de
cierta noticia que tenia de vnas minas muy ricas.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The mines discovered.</i></span>
Lo qual puesto por obra se partio con las guias
que lleuaua, y como vuiesse caminado hazia el
proprio Poniente quarenta y cinco leguas, topo
con las dichas minas, y saco con sus proprias
manos riquissimos metales, y de mucha plata y
las minas, que eran de vna veta muy ancha,
estauan en vna sierra adonde se podia subir con
facilidad, a causa de hauer para ello camino
abierto. Cerca delas auia algunos pueblos de
Indios serranos que les hizieron amistad, y los
salieron a recebir con Cruzes en las cabe&ccedil;as, y
otras sennales de paz.
<span class="sidenote"><i>A great river.</i></span>
Aqui cerca toparon dos
rios razonables, a cuyas orillas hauia muchas
patras de vnas muy buenas, y grandes noguerales,
y mucho lino como lo de Castilla, y dixeron por
sennas que detras de aquellas sierras estaua vno
que tenia mas de ocho leguas de ancho, pero no
se pudo entender que tan cerca,

aunque hizieron
demonstracion que corria hazia la mar del Norte,
y que en las riberas del de vna y otra banda ay
muchas pueblos tan grandes, que en su comparacion
a quellos en que est aua eran barrios.</p>

<p>Despues de hauer tomado toda esta relacion,
se partio el dicho Capitan para la Prouincia de
Zuny, adonde hauia mendado yr a los dichos
companneros: y como llegasse a ella con salud,
hauiendo ydo por muy buen camino, hallo con
<!--095.png-->
<span class="pagenum">98</span>
ella a sus cinco companneros, y al dicho padre
Fray Bernardino con los soldados que se auian
determinado de boluer, como ya diximos, que
aun no se auian partido, por ciertas ocasiones: a
los quales los naturales hauian hecho muy buen
tratamiento, y dadoles todo lo necessario muy
complida mente, haziendo despues lo mesmo con
el capitan, y los que con el venian, a quien
salieron a recebir con demonstracion de alegria,
y dieron muchos bastimentos para la jornada que
hauian de hazar, rogandoles que boluissen con
breuedad, y traxessen muchos Castillas (que assi
llaman a los Espannoles) y que a todos les darian
de comer. Por lo qual para poderlo hazar con
comodidad auian sembrado a quel anno mas trigo
y semillas, que en todos los passados.</p>

<p>En este tiempo se retificaron en su primera
determinacion el dicho religioso, y los soldados
arriba dichos, y accordaron de boluerse a la prouincia

queda dicho, a quien se junto Gregorio Hernandez

<div class="DescrHdr2"><a name="a247" id="a247"></a>A briefe relation of two notable voyages, the first made by frier
Augustin Ruyz a Franciscan, in the yeere 1581: the
second by Antonio de Espejo in the yere 1583: who
together with his company discouered a land wherein they
found fifteene prouinces all full of townes, conteining
houses of foure and fiue stories high, which they named
New Mexico; for that in many respects it resembleth the
prouince of olde Mexico. This land is situate to the
North of Nueua Espanna, and stretcheth from 24 to 34
degrees and better: by the which and by other inhabited
lands it is thought that men may trauell euen to Terra de
Labrador. Taken out of the history of China written by
Frier Iuan Gonzales de Mendo&ccedil;a, and printed in Madrid
1586.</div>

<p>I haue now declared in the title of this present discourse, that
in the yeere 1583 there were discouered fifteene prouinces, which
the discouerers called New Mexico, situate on the firme land of
Nueua Espanna, and I promised to giue notice of the sayd discouery
which I will do with as much breuity as is possible: for
if I should record at large all particulars which they saw and
came to the knowledge of, it would require a full history. The
substance thereof is as followeth.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The first voyage made by Frier Augustin Ruiz to the
prouince de los Tiguas.</span>
In the yere of our Lord 1581, a certaine Franciscan
frier called Augustin Ruiz which dwelt in the valley
of S. Bartholomew, being informed by the report of
certaine Indians called Conchos, which had dealings
and conuersation with other of their neighbours
called Passaguates; that toward the North, trauelling
always by land, there were certaine great townes not hitherto
knowen nor discouered by our Spanyards; moved with a zeale of
charity and a desire to saue soules, craued licence of the Conde
of Corunna as then Viceroy of Nueua Espanna, and of his superiors,
to go to the sayd townes, and to indeuour to learne their
language, and hauing learned the same to baptise them and to
preach the holy Gospel vnto them. After he had obteined
licence of the parties aforesayd, taking with him other two companions
of his owne order, and eight souldiers, who of their owne
<!--098.png-->
<span class="pagenum">101</span>
good will offered to beare him company, he departed
to put in execution his Christian and zealous intent.
<span class="sidenote">The chiefe of these 8 soldiers was Francisco
Sanchez Xamuzeado which made a map of these prouinces, which being
intercepted is come to our hands.</span>
Who after certeine dayes trauell came vnto a countrey
called The prouince de los Tiguas distant from the
mines of Santa Barbara, from whence they began
their iourney, 250 leagues towards the North: in
which prouince the inhabitants, vpon a certaine
occasion, slew one of the sayd friers two companions.
The souldiers that went with him seeing this mishap,
and perceiuing the successe, and likewise fearing,
that thereof might happen some greater danger, determined
with a common consent to return vnto the mines from
whence they departed: considering that their company was too
small to resist the dangers that might happen, being so farre distant
from the dwellings of the Spanyards, and from all necessary
succour. But the two friers which remained aliue did not onely
refuse their determination, but rather seeing fit occasion to put
their good desire in execution, and so great a haruest ripe for the
Lords table, because they could not persuade the souldiers to
proceed any further in that discouery, remained behinde in the
sayd prouince with three Indian boyes and one Mesti&ccedil;o whom
they had carried with them; thinking that although they remained
alone, yet should they be there in securitie, by reason of
the great affability and loue which the people of that place
shewed vnto them.</p>

<p>The eight souldiours being returned to their wished home,
immediatly sent newes of all that had passed to the Viceroy vnto
the city of Mexico, which is distant from the sayd mines of Santa
Barbara 160 leagues.</p>

<p>The friers of Sant Francis were much agrieued at the staying
of their brethren behinde in the countrey, and fearing least the
Sauages would kill them seeing them left alone, they began to
mooue the minds of certaine souldiers to make another voyage
to the sayd prouince in the company of another Frier of the foresayd
Order called Frier Bernardin Beltran, to deliuer the aforesayd
two religious men out of danger, and to prosecute their
former enterprise.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The second voyage.</span>
At the same time there was at the foresayd mines vpon some
occasion a citizen of Mexico called Antonio de
Espejo, a rich man, and of great courage and industry,
and very zealous in the seruice of king Philip his
<!--099.png-->
<span class="pagenum">102</span>
souereigne, and was borne in Cordoua. Who vnderstanding the
desire of the foresayd friers, and the importance of the action,
offered himselfe to go on that voyage, and also to spend part of
his substance, and to aduenture his life therein; conditionally
that licence might be granted him to the same purpose from some
person sufficiently authorised by his Maiestie. Which licence at
the sayd friers procurement was granted vnto him by the gouernour
Iuan de Ontiueros the kings Alcade may&oacute;r or chiefe Iustice
in the towns called Las quatro Cienegas situate within the
iurisdiction of Nueua Biscaya seuenty leagues from the sayd
mines of Santa Barbara; authorizing him both to take in hand
the sayd voyage, and also to assemble such people and souldiers
as he could, which might accompany and ayde him in the performance
of this his Christian intent.</p>

<p>The sayd Antonio de Espejo was so earnest in this matter, that
in very few dayes he had gathered a company of souldiers, and
made prouision of things necessary for his voyage, spending
therein a good part of his substance. And he departed with his
whole company from the valley of S. Bartholomew the tenth of
Nouember 1582; taking with him (for whatsoeuer should happen)
115 horses and mules, with great store of weapons, munition,
and victuals, and some Indians to serue him in his iourney.</p>

<p>Directing his course toward the North, after two dayes iourney
he met with great store of the foresayd Indians called Conchos,
which dwell in villages or hamlets of cottages couered with straw.
Who, assoone as they vnderstood of his approch, hauing newes
thereof long before, came foorth to receiue him with shewes of
great ioy. The food of this people and of all the rest of that
prouince, which is great, are conies, hares, and deere which they
kill, of all which they haue great abundance. Also they haue
great store of Maiz or Indian wheat, gourds, and melons very
good and plentifull: and there are many riuers full of excellent
fish of diuers sorts. They goe almost naked, and the weapons
that they vse are bowes and arrowes, and liue vnder the gouernment
and lordship of CaÃ§iques like those of Mexico: they found
no idols among them, neither could they vnderstand that they
worshipped any thing, whereupon they easily consented that the
Spanyards should set vp crosses, and were very well content
therewith, after they were informed by our friers of the signification
thereof, which was done by the interpreters that they caried
with them; by whose meanes they vnderstood of other townes,
<!--100.png-->
<span class="pagenum">103</span>
whither the said Conchos did conduct them, and bare them
company aboue foure and twenty leagues, all which way was
inhabited with people of their owne nation: and at all places
where they came they were peaceably receiued by aduice that
was sent by the Ca&ccedil;iques from one towne to another.</p>

<p>Hauing passed the foure and twenty leagues aforesayd, they
came vnto another nation of Indians called Passaguates, who
liue after the maner of the foresayd Conchos their borderers,
and did vnto them as the others had done, conducting them
forward other foure dayes iourney, with aduice of the Caciques as
before.
<span class="sidenote">Very great and rich siluer mines.</span>
The Spanyards found in this iourney many
mines of siluer, which according to the iudgement of
skilfull men, were very plentifull and rich in metall.</p>

<p>A dayes iourney from thence they met with another nation
called Tobosos, who so soone as they beheld the countenance
of our people fledde vnto the mountaines, leauing their townes
and houses desolate. Afterward wee vnderstood that certeine
yeeres past there came vnto that place certaine souldiers to seeke
mines, who caried away captiue certaine of the people of the
countrey, which caused the rest of them to be so shey and fearefull.
The captaine sent messengers to call them backe againe,
assuring them that they should not sustaine any harme, and
handled the matter so discreetly, that many of them returned,
whom he made much of, and gaue them gifts, vsing them kindly,
and declaring vnto them by the interpreter, that their comming
was not to hurt any man: whereupon they were all quieted, and
were content that they should set vp crosses, and declare the
mystery of the same, making shew that they were highly pleased
therewith. For proofe whereof they accompanied them on their
voyage, as their neighbours had done, vntill they had brought
them to a countrey inhabited by another nation, which was
distant from theirs some 12 leagues. They vse bowes and arrowes
and go naked.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Iumanos or Patarabueyes.</span>
The nation vnto which the sayd Tobosos conducted them, is
called Iumanos, whom the Spanyards by another
name call Patarabueyes: their prouince is very great,
conteining many townes and great store of people:
their houses are flat roofed, and built of lime and stone, and the
streets of their townes are placed in good order. All the men
and women haue their faces, armes and legges raced and
pounced: they are a people of great stature, and of better
<!--101.png-->
<span class="pagenum">104</span>
gouernment, then the rest which they had seene in their former
iourneys: and are well prouided of victuals, and furnished with
plenty of wilde beasts, fowles and fishes,
<span class="sidenote">Rio turbioso del Norte.</span>
by reason
of mighty riuers from the North, whereof
one is as great as Guadalquiuir, which falleth into
the North sea or bay of Mexico. Here also are many lakes of
salt water, which at a certeine time of the yere waxeth hard, and
becommeth very good salt. They are a warlike people, and
soone made shew thereof: for the first night that our people
incamped there, with their arrowes they slew fiue horses, and
wounded fiue other very sore, nor would not haue left one of
them aliue, if they had not beene defended by our guard.
<span class="sidenote">Rio del Norte.</span>
Hauing done this mischiefe, they abandoned the towne, and withdrew
themselues to a mountaine which was hard by, whither our
captaine went betimes in the morning, taking with him fiue souldiers
well armed, and an interpreter called Peter an Indian of their
owne nation, and with good persuasions appeased them, causing
them to descend to their towne and houses, and persuading them
to giue aduice vnto their neighbours, that they were men that
would hurt no body, neither came they thither to take away their
goods: which he obtained easily by his wisedome, and by giuing
vnto the Caciques certeine bracelets of glasse beads, with hats
and other trifles, which he caried with him for the same purpose;
so by this meanes, and by the good interteinment which they
gaue them, many of them accompanied our Spanyards for
certeine dayes, alwayes trauelling along the banke of the great
riuer abouesayd; along the which there were many
townes of the Indians of this nation, which continued
for the space of twelue dayes trauel, all which
time the Caciques having receiued aduice from one to another,
came forth to interteine our people without their bowes and
arrowes, and brought them plenty of victuals, with other presents
and gifts, especially hides and chamois-skins wery well dressed,
so that those of Flanders do nothing exceed them. These
people are all clothed, and seemed to haue some light of our
holy faith: for they made signes to God, looking vp towards
heauen, and call him in their language Apalito, and acknowledge
him for their Lord, from whose bountifull hand and mercy they
confesse that they haue receiued their life and being, and these
worldly goods. Many of them with their wiues and children
came vnto the frier (which the captaine and souldiers brought
<!--102.png-->
<span class="pagenum">105</span>
with them) that hee might crosse and blesse them.
<span class="sidenote">Pamphilo de Naruaez entred into Florida
1527.</span>
Who
demanding of them, from whom they had receiued that knowledge
of God, they answered, from three Christians and one
Negro which passed that way, and remained certaine dayes
among them, who by the signes which they made, were Aluaro
Nunnez, Cabeca de Vaca, and Dorantes, and Castillo Maldonado,
and a Negro; all which escaped of the company
which Pamphilo de Naruaez landed in Florida; who
after they had bene many dayes captiues and
slaues, escaped and came to these townes, by whom
God shewed many miracles, and healed onely by the touching of
their hands many sicke persons, by reason wherof they became
very famous in all that countrey.
<span class="sidenote">Rio del Norte. Another prouince.</span>
All this prouince
remained in great peace and security; in token
wherof, they accompanied and serued our men
certaine dayes, trauelling along by the great riuer
aforesayd.</p>

<p>Within few days after they came vnto another great prouince
of Indians, from whence they came forth to receiue them,
vpon the newes which they had heard of their neighbors, and
brought them many curious things made of feathers of diuers
colours, and many mantles of cotton straked with blew and
white, like those that are brought from China, to barter and
trucke them for other things. All of them both men, women
and children were clad in chamois skinnes very good and
wel dressed.
<span class="sidenote">Very great quantity of siluer.</span>
Our people could neuer vnderstand what
nation they were for lacke of an interpreter: howbeit they
dealt with them by signes; and hauing shewed vnto them
certaine stones of rich metall, and inquired whether there were
any such in their countrey: they answered by the
same signes, that fiue dayes iourney Westward from
thence there was great quantity therof, and that they
would conduct them thither, and shew it vnto them; as afterward
they performed their promise, and bare them company 22
leagues, which was all inhabited by people of the same nation.</p>

<p>Next vnto the foresayd prouince they came vnto another
further vp the great riuer aforesayd, being much more populous
then the former, of whom they were well receiued, and welcomed
with many presents, especially of fish, whereof they haue exceeding
great store, by reason of certaine great lakes not far
from thence, wherein they are bred in foresayd plenty. They
<!--103.png-->
<span class="pagenum">106</span>
stayed among these people three days; all which time both
day and night they made before them many dances, according
to their fashion, with signification of speciall ioy. They could
not learne the name of this nation for want of an interpreter,
yet they vnderstood that it extended very farre, and was very
great. Among these people they found an Indian of the
foresayd nation of the Conchos, who told them, and shewed
them by signes, that fifteene dayes iourney from thence toward
the West there was a very broad lake, and nere vnto it very
great townes, and in them houses of three or foure stories
high, and that the people were well apparelled, and the countrey
full of victuals and prouision. This Concho offered himselfe
to conduct our men thither; whereat our company reioyced,
but left off the enterprise, onely to accomplish their intent for
which they vndertook the voyage, which was to go Northward
to giue ayd vnto the two friers aforesayd. The chiefe
and principall thing that they noted in this prouince was, that
it was of very good temperature, and a very rich soile, and
had great store of wilde beasts, and wild fowle, and abundance
of rich metals, and other excellent things, and very profitable.</p>

<p>From this prouince they folowed their iourney for the space
of fifteene dayes without meeting any people all that while,
passing thorow great woods and groues of pine trees bearing
such fruit as those of Castile: at the end whereof, having
trauelled, to their iudgement, fourescore leagues, they came
vnto a small hamlet or village of fewe people, in whose poore
cottages couered with straw they found many deeres-skinnes
as well dressed as those of Flanders, with great store of excellent
white salt. They gave our men good entertainment for
the space of two dayes while they remained there, after which
they bare them company about twelue leagues, vnto certaine
great townes, alwayes travelling by the riuer called Rio del
Norte abouesayd, till such time as they came vnto the countrey
called by them New Mexico. Here all along the shore of
the sayd riuer grew mighty woods of poplar being in some
places foure leagues broad, and great store of walnut trees,
and vines like those of Castillia.</p>

<p>Hauing trauelled two dayes thorow the said woods of
Poplar and Walnut trees, they came to ten townes situate on
both sides of the sayd riuer, besides others which they might
see further out of the way, wherein they seemed to be great
<!--104.png-->

store of people, and those which they saw were aboue ten
thousand persons. In this prouince they received them very
courteously, and brought them to their townes, whereas they
gaue them plenty of victuals and hennes of the countrey, with
many other things, and that with great good will. Here they
found houses of foure stories high, very well built, with gallant
lodgings, and in most of them were Stooues for the Winter
season. Their garments were of Cotton and of deere-skinnes,
and the attire both of the men and women is after the maner
of the Indians of the kingdome of Mexico. But the strangest
thing of all was to see both men and women weare shooes and
boots with good soles of neats leather, a thing which they
never sawe in any other part of the Indies. The women
keepe their haire well combed and dressed, wearing nothing
els vpon their heads. In all these townes they had Caciques,
which gouerned their people like the Caciques of Mexico,
with Sergeants to execute their commandments, who goe
thorow the townes proclaiming with a loud voice the pleasure
of the Caciques, commanding the same to be put in execution.
In this prouince our men found many idols which they worshipped,
and particularly they had in euery house an Oratory for
the diuell, whereinto they ordinarily cary him meat: and another
thing they found, that as it is an vse among the Christians to
erect crosses vpon the high wayes, so haue this people certain high
chapels, in which they say the diuell vseth to take his ease, and to
recreat himselfe as he trauelleth from one towne to another;
which chapels are maruellously well trimmed and painted. In
all their arable grounds, wherof they haue great plenty, they
erect on the one side a little cottage or shed standing vpon foure
studdes, vnder which the labourers do eat, and passe away the
heat of the day, for they are a people much giuen to labour, and
doe continually occupy themselues therein.
<span class="sidenote">These high mountains are a cause of the coldness
of the countrey.</span>
This
countrey is full of mountaines and forrests of Pine
trees. The weapons that they vse are strong bowes
and arrowes headed with flints, which will pierce
thorow a coat of male, and macanas which are clubs
of halfe a yard long, so beset with sharpe flints, that they are
sufficient to cleaue a man asunder in the midst: they vse also a
kinde of targets made of raw hides.</p>

<p>Hauing remained foure dayes in this prouince, not farre
off they came to another called The prouince of Tiguas
<!--105.png-->
<span class="pagenum">108</span>
conteining sixteene townes, in one wherof, called Poala, they
vnderstood that the inhabitants had slaine the two fathers
aforesayd, to wit, frier Francis Lopez, and frier Augustus Ruyz
whom they went to seeke, together with the three Indian boyes,
and the mestiÃ§o. So soone as the people of this towne and
their neighbours saw our men there, their own consciences
accusing them, and fearing that our men came to punish them,
and to be auenged of the death of the foresaid fathers, they durst
not abide their comming, but leauing their houses desolate they
fled to the mountaines next adioyning, from whence they could
neuer cause them to descend, although our men attempted the
same by diuers deuises and entisements. They found in the
townes and houses good store of victuals, with infinite number
of hennes in the countrey, and many sorts of metals, wherof
some seemed to be very good. They could not perfectly
vnderstand what numbers of people this prouince might conteine,
by reason they were fled into the mountains, as I haue
said before.</p>

<p>Hauing found those to be slaine which they went to seeke,
they entred into consultation, whether they should returne to
Nueua Biscaya, from whence they came, or should proceed
further in their iourney; whereabout there were diuers opinions:
howbeit, vnderstanding there, that toward the Orient or East
parts of that prouince,
<span class="sidenote">This draweth toward Virginia.</span>
and very far distant from
thence, there were great and rich townes: and finding
themselues so far on the way, the sayd captaine
Antonio de Espeio with the consent of the foresaid frier called
Frier Bernardine Beltron, and the greater part of his souldiers
and companions determined to proceed on the discouery, till
such time as they did see to what end it would come; to the end
they might giue certeine and perfect knowledge thereof to his
Maiesty, as eye-witnesses of the same. And so with one accord
they determined, that while the army lay still there, the captaine
and two more of his company should prosecute their desire,
which they did accordingly. And within two dayes iourney they
came vnto another prouince, where they found eleuen townes, and
much people in them; which in their iudgement were aboue forty
thousand persons. The country was very fertile and plentifull,
whose confines bordered vpon the territories of Cibola, where
there are great store of kine, with whose hides and with cotton
they apparell themselues, imitating in the forme of their gouernment
<!--106.png-->
<span class="pagenum">109</span>
their next neighbours. In this place are signes of very rich
mines, some quantity of the metals whereof they found in the
houses of the Indians; which Indians haue and doe worship
idols. They receiued our men peaceably, and gaue them
victuals. Hauing seene this much, and the disposition of the
countrey, they returned to the campe, from whence they departed,
to informe their companions of the things aboue mentioned.</p>

<p>Being returned to the campe they had intelligence of another
prouince called Los Quires,
<span class="sidenote">Quires bordering vpon Rio del Norte.</span>
which stood sixe leagues
higher vp the riuer called Rio del Norte. And in
their iourney thitherward, being arriued within a
league of the place, there came forth very many
Indians to receiue them in peace, requesting them to beare them
company to their townes: which they did, and were maruellous
well interteined and cherished. In this prouince they found fiue
townes only. Wherein were great store of people, and those
which they saw were aboue 14000 soules, who worship idols as
their neighbours do. In one of these townes they found a pie in
a cage after the maner of Castile, and certaine shadowes or
canopies like vnto those which are brought from China, wherein
were painted the Sunne, the Moone, and many Starres. Where
hauing taken the height of the pole-starre, they found themselues
to be in 37 degrees and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of Northerly latitude.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Cunames, or Punames. Cia a great city.</span>
They departed out of this prouince, and keeping still the
same Northerly course, fourteene leagues from thence
they found another prouince called The Cunames,
where they saw other fiue townes, the greatest whereof
was called Cia, being so large, that it conteined eight
market-places, the houses whereof being plaistered and painted
with diuers colours, were better then any which they had seene
in the prouinces before mentioned: the people which they heere
saw, they esteemed to be aboue twenty thousand persons. They
presented to our men many curious mantles, and victuals
excellently well dressed; so that our men deemed this nation to
be more curious, and of greater ciuility, and better gouernment,
then any other that hitherto they had seene. They shewed them
rich metals, and the mountaines also not farre off whereout they
digged them. Heere our people heard of another prouince
standing toward the Northwest, wherevnto they purposed
to goe.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Ameies, or Emexes.</span>
Hauing trauelled about sixe leagues, they came to the sayd
<!--107.png-->
<span class="pagenum">110</span>
prouince, the people whereof were called Ameies,
wherin were seuen very great townes, conteining, to
their iudgement, aboue thirty thousand soules. They
reported that one of the seuen townes was very great and faire,
which our men would not go to see, both because it stood
behinde a mountaine, and also for feare of some mishappe, if in
case they should be separated one from another. This people
are like vnto their neighbours of the former prouince, being as
well prouided of all necessaries as they, and of as good gouernment.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Acoma or Acoman a towne conteining aboue 6000
persons.</span>
About fifteene leagues from this prouince, trauelling alwayes
toward the West, they found a great towne called
Acoma, conteining aboue sixe thousand persons, and
situate vpon an high rocke which was aboue fifty
paces hie, hauing no other entrance but by a ladder
or paire of staires hewen into the same rocke, whereat
our people maruelled not a little: all the water of this towne
was kept in cisternes. The chiefe men of this towne came peaceably
to visit the Spanyards, bringing them many mantles and
chamois-skinnes excellently dressed, and great plenty of victuals.
Their corne-fields are two leagues from thence, and they fetch
water out of a small riuer nere thereunto, to water the same, on
the brinks whereof they saw many great banks of Roses like
those of Castile. Here are many mountaines that beare shewes
of mettals, but they went not to see them, because the Indians
dwelling vpon them are many in number, and very warlike. Our
men remained in this place three dayes, vpon one of the which
the inhabitants made before them a very solemne dance, comming
foorth in the same with gallant apparell, vsing very witty sports,
wherewith our men were exceedingly delighted.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Zuny or Sunne.</span>
Twenty foure leagues from hence toward the West, they came
to a certaine prouince called by the inhabitants
themselues Zuny, and by the Spanyards Cibola, containing
great numbers of Indians;
<span class="sidenote">Vasquez de Coronado was here 1540 and 1541.</span>
in which prouince Francisco
Vasquez de Coronado had bene, and had erected
many crosses and other tokens of Christianity, which
remained as yet standing. Heere also they found
three Indian Christians which had remained there
euer since the said iourny, whose names were Andrew de
Culiacan, Gaspar de Mexico, and Antonio de Guadalajara, who
had almost forgotten their owne language, but could speake that
<!--108.png-->
<span class="pagenum">111</span>
countrey speech very well; howbeit after some small conference
with our men, they easily vnderstood one another.
<span class="sidenote">A mighty lake 60 daies iourney from Cibola.</span>
By these
three Indians they were informed, that threescore
dayes iourney from this place there was a very
mighty lake, vpon the bankes whereof stood many
great and good townes, and that the inhabitants
of the same had plenty of golde, an euident argument wherof
was their wearing of golden bracelets and earrings: and also
that after the sayd Francis Vasquez de Coronado had perfect
intelligence thereof, hee departed out of this prouince of Cibola
to goe thither, and that hauing proceeded twelue dayes iourney,
he began to want water; and thereupon determined to returne,
as he did indeed, with intention to make a second voyage thither
at his better opportunity; which afterward he performed not,
being preuented of his determined iourney by death.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Another mightie prouince Westward of Cibola 28.
leagues, called Mohotze.</span>
Vpon the newes of these riches the sayd Captaine Antony de
Espeio was desirous to go thither; and though some of his
companions were of his opinion, yet the greater part and the frier
were of the contrary, saying that it was now high time to returne
home to New Biscay from whence they came, to giue account of
that which they seene: which the sayd greater part within
few dayes put in execution, leauing the captaine with nine companions
onely that willingly followed him: who after hee had
fully certified himselfe of the riches abouesayd, and
of the great quantity of excellent mettals that were
about that lake, departed out of this prouince of
Cibola with his companions; and travelling directly
toward the West, after hee had passed 28 leagues, he
found another very great prouince, which by
estimation contained aboue 5000 soules: the
inhabitants whereof assoone as they vnderstood of their approch,
sent them word, vpon paine of death to come no neerer to their
townes: whereto the captaine answered, that their comming was
in no wise to hurt them, as they should well perceiue, and
therefore requested them not to molest him in his intended
voyage, and withall gaue to the messenger a reward of such
things as they brought with them: who thereupon made so good
report of our people, and so appeased the troubled minds of the
Indians, that they granted them free accesse vnto their townes,
and so they went thither with 15. Indians their friends of
the prouince of Cibola aforesaid, and the three Mexican Indians
<!--109.png-->
<span class="pagenum">112</span>
before mentioned. When they were come within a league of the
first towne, there came forth to meete them aboue 2000. Indians
laden with victuals, whom the Captaine rewarded with some
things of small value, which they made great accompt of, and
esteemed more precious than gold.
<span class="sidenote">Zaguato, or Ahuxto a towne.</span>
As they approched neere
vnto the towne which was named Zaguato, a great
multitude of Indians came forth to meete them, and
among the rest their Ca&ccedil;iques, with so great demonstration
of ioy and gladnes, that they cast much
meale of Maiz vpon the ground for the horses to tread vpon:
with this triumph they entred the towne, where they were
very wel lodged and much made of, which the Captaine did in
part requite, giuing to the chiefest among them hats, and beads
of glasse, with many such trifles, which he caried with him for
the like purpose. The said Caciques presently gaue notice to
the whole prouince of the arriual of these new guests, whom they
reported to bee a courteous people, and such as offered them no
harme: which was occasion sufficient to make them all come
laden with presents vnto our people, and to intreat them to goe
and make merry with them in their townes; which they yeelded
vnto, though always with great foresight what might
follow.
<span class="sidenote">A witty policie to be vsed by the English in like
cases.</span>
Whereupon the Captaine vsed a certaine
policie, making the Caciques beleeue, that forasmuch
as his horses were very fierce (for they had told the
Indians that they would kill them) therefore it was
necessary to make a Fort of lime and stone to inclose them, for
the auoyding of such inconueniences as otherwise might happen
vnto the Indians by them. This tale was so steadfastly beleeued
by the Caciques, that in fiue houres they assembled such store of
people together, that with incredible celeritie they built the said
Fort which our men required.</p>

<p>Moreouer, when the Captaine saide that he would depart, they
brought vnto him a present of 40000. mantles of cotton, both
white and other colours, and great store of hand towels, with
tassels at the corners, with diuers other things, and among the
rest rich mettals, which seemed to holde much siluer. Among
these Indians they learned very much concerning The great Lake
aforesaide, whose report agreed wholly with relation of the
former, as touching the riches and great abundance of gold about
that lake.</p>

<p>The Captaine reposing great confidence in this people and in
<!--110.png-->
<span class="pagenum">113</span>
their good disposition toward him determined after certaine dayes,
to leaue there fiue of his companions with the rest of his Indian
friends, that they might returne with his cariages to the prouince
of Zuni, while himselfe with the foure other which remained
should ride in post to discouer certaine very rich Mines, whereof
he had perfect information. And putting this purpose in execution
he departed with his guides, and hauing traueiled due-west
45. leagues he came vnto the said Mines, and tooke out of the
same with his owne hands exceeding rich metals holding great
quantitie of siluer: and the mines which were of a very broad
veine were in a mountaine whereon they might easily ascend, by
reason of an open way that led vp to the same. Neere vnto these mines were
certaine townes of Indians dwelling upon the mountaine
whereon they might easily ascend, by reason of an open
way that led vp to the same. Neere vnto these
mines were certaine townes of Indians dwelling vpon the mountaines, who
shewed them friendship, and came forth to receiue them with
crosses on their heads, and other tokens of peace.
Hereabout they found two riuers of a reasonable bignesse, vpon the banks
whereof grew many vines bearing excellent grapes, and great
groues of walnut trees, and much flaxe like that of Castile: and
they shewed our men by signes, that behinde those
mountaines there was a riuer about 8. leagues broad,
<span class="sidenote">Perhaps this Riuer may fall into the Chesepiouk
bay, or into the great lake of Tadoac.</span>
but they could not learne how neere it was: howbeit
the Indians made demonstration that it ran towards
the North sea, and that vpon both sides thereof stood
many townes of so great bignesse, that in comparison
thereof those wherein they dwelt were but small
hamlets.</p>

<p>After he had receiued all this information, the said Captaine
returned toward the prouince of Zuni, whither he had sent his
said companions: and being arrived there in safety, hauing
trauailed vpon a very good way, he found in the same place
his 5. companions, and the said father Frier Bernardin Beltran,
with the souldiers which were determined to returne, as is
aforesaid, but vpon certaine occasions were not as yet departed:
whom the inhabitants had most friendly treated, and
furnished with all things necessary in abundance as afterward
likewise they vsed the Captaine, and those that came with him,
comming foorth to meete them with shew of great ioy, and giuing
them great store of victuals to serue them in their iourney homewards,
<!--111.png-->
<span class="pagenum">114</span>
and requesting them to returne againe with speed, and to
bring many Castilians with them (for so they call the Spaniards)
to whom they promised food sufficient. For the better performance
wherof they sowed that yeere more graine and other fruits,
then they had done at any time before.</p>

<p>At this present the Frier and souldiers aforesaid resolued
themselues in their former determination, and agreed to returne
vnto the prouince from whence they came with intention before
mentioned, to seeke the two Friers that were slaine, to whom
also Gregorio Hermandez who had bene standard-bearer in the
iourney, ioyned himselfe. Who being departed, the Captaine
accompanied onely with 8. souldiers, determined to prosecute his
former attempt, and to passe vp higher the saide riuer called Rio
del Norte, which he did accordingly. And hauing traueiled
about 60. leagues toward the prouince of the Quires aforesaid, 12
leagues from thence toward the Orient or East they found a
prouince of Indians called Hubates, who receiued them peaceably,
and gaue them great store of victuals, informing them also
of very rich Mines which they found whereout they got glistening
and good metal, and therewith returned to the towne from
whence they came. This prouince contained by their estimation
25000. persons all very well apparelled in coloured mantles of
cotton, and Chamois-skins very well dressed. They haue many
mountaines full of Pines and Cedars, and the houses of their
townes are of 4. and 5. stories high.
<span class="sidenote">Their returne.</span>
Here they had notice of
another prouince distant about one dayes iourney from thence
inhabited by certaine Indians called Tamos, and containing
aboue 40000 soules: whither being come the inhabitants would
neither giue them any victuals, nor admit them into their townes:
for which cause, and in regard of the danger wherein they were,
and because some of the souldiers were not well at ease, and for
that they were so fewe (as we haue said) they determined
to departe thence, and to returne toward the
land of the Christians, which they put in execution in the beginning
of Iuly 1583, being guided by an Indian that went with
them, who led them another way then they went forth by, downe
a riuer, which they called Rio de las vacas; that is to say, The
riuer of oxen, in respect of the great multitudes of oxen or kine
that fed vpon the bankes therof, by the which they traueiled for
the space of 120. leagues, still meeting with store of the said
cattell. From hence they went forward to the riuer of Conchos
<!--112.png-->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
by which they entered, and thence to the valley of S. Bartholomew,
from whence they first entered into their discouerie.
Vpon their coming thither they found that the said Frier Bernardin
Beltran and his company were safely arriued at the said
towne many dayes before, and were gone from thence to the
towne of Guadiana. In this towne the foresaid captaine Anthony
de Espeio made most certaine relation of all that is aforesaid,
which relation presently hee sent vnto the Conde of Corunna
Vizroy of Nueua Espanna, who sent the same to his Maiestie,
and the Lords of his royal counsel in the Indies, to the end they
might take such order as they thought best, which they haue
already performed with great care and circumspection.</p>

<p>Almighty God vouchsafe his assistance in this busines, that
such numbers of soules redeemed by his blood may not vtterly
perish, of whose good capacitie, wherein they exceed those of
Mexico and Peru (as we be giuen to vnderstand by those that
haue delt with them) we may boldly presume that they will
easily embrace the Gospel, and abandon such idolatrie as now
the most of them doe liue in: which Almightie God graunt
for his honour, and glory, and for the increase of the holy
Catholique faith.</p>

<span class="sidenote">500. Spaniards sent to conquer the great citie of
Cibola which is 400. leagues from Mexico Northwestward.</span>
There are departed out of Mexico and other townes hereabout
by the commaundement of the Viceroy 500. souldiers Spaniards,
vnder the conduct of Rodrigo del Rio the gouernour of Nueua
Biscaia which are gone to win a great City called Cibola, which
is 400. leagues beyond Mexico to the Northwest, and
standeth vp in the maine land. It is by report a
very great citie, as bigge as Mexico, and a very rich
countrey both of golde Mines and siluer Mines: and
the King of the countrey is a mighty King, and he
will not become subiect to his Maiestie. There were
certaine Spaniards sent to that king from the Viceroy
in an ambassage: It is thought that they are
slaine, for we can here no newes of them.</p>

<p>The other newes that I can certifie you of at this instant is,
that there is a Iudge of the city of Guadalajara called don
Nunno de villa Inscensia lately maried. Also the kings Atturney
of Guadalajara maried his daughter of 8. yeres old with a boy of
12. yeres old. But the Viceroy saith that he hath a warrant
from his Maiestie, that if any Iudge whatsoeuer dwelling in that
kingdome of Guadalajara should mary any sonne in that iurisdiction,
that then the said Viceroy is to depriue him of his office.
And therefore he went about to depriue the Iudge and the
kings Attourney of their offices.
<span class="sidenote">A dangerous rebellion in Guadalajara a prouince of

Whereupon the people of that
prouince would not thereunto consent, nor suffer them to be
dismissed of their offices, nor to be arrested, nor caried prisoners

the Countrey did resist his commandement, and would not suffer
them to be apprehended, he sent certaine Captaines with souldiers
to goe and apprehend the Iudge, the kings Attourney, and as
many as did take their parts. So the citizens of Guadalajara
withstood the viceroies forces, and put themselues in defence;
and are up in armes against the viceroy: yet they do not rebel

against the king, but say: God saue king Philip, and
will submit themselues to his Maiestie, but not to the

vp in armes, and are all in a mutinie against vs of
Mexico. I beseech Almighty God to remedy it, and
that it may be qualified in time: or else all Noua Spania will
be vtterly spoiled. I write this thing, because it is publiquely

poore little villages, containing 20. or 30. cottages a piece, and
by the inhabitants thereof hee vnderstoode that from thence
forward there were nothing but exceeding rough mountaines
which ran very farre, vtterly disinhabited and voyd of people.
And because it was labour lost, I would not write vnto your
Lordship thereof.</p>

<p>It grieued the whole company, that a thing so highly commended,
and whereof the father had made so great bragges,
should be found so contrary, and it made them suspect that all
the rest would fall out in like sort. Which when I perceiued I
sought to encourage them the best I coulde, telling them that
your Lordshippe alwayes was of opinion, that this voyage was a
thing cast away, and that we should fixe our cogitation vpon
those seuen Cities, and other prouinces, whereof wee had knowledge:
that there should bee the ende of our enterprise: and
<!--116.png-->
<span class="pagenum">119</span>
with this resolution and purpose wee all marched cheerefully
through a very badde way which was not passible but one by
one, or else wee must force out with Pioners the path which wee
founde, wherewith the Souldiours were not a little offended,
finding all that the Frier had sayde to bee quite contrary: for
among other things which the father sayde and affirmed, this was
one, that the way was plaine and good, and that there was but
one small hill of halfe a league in length. And yet in trueth
there are mountaines which although the way were well mended
could not bee passed without great danger of breaking the horses
neckes: and the way was such, that of the cattel which your
Lordship sent vs for the prouision of our armie wee lost a great
part in the voyage through the roughnesse of the rockes. The
lambes and sheepe lost their hoofes in the way: and of those
which I brought from Culiacan, I left the greater part at the
Riuer of Lachimi, because they could not keepe company with
vs, and because they might come softly after vs, foure men
on horsebacke remained with them which are nowe come
vnto vs, and haue brought vs not past foure and twentie lambes,
and foure sheepe, for all the rest were dead with trauailing through
that rough passage, although they trauailed but two leagues a
day, and rested themselues euery day.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The valley of the people called Caracones.</span>
At length I arriued at the valley of the people called
Caracones, the 26. day of the moneth of May: and
from Culiacan vntill I came thither, I could not helpe
my selfe, saue onely with a great quantitie of Maiz:
for seeing the Maiz in the fieldes, were not yet ripe, I
was constrained to leaue them all behind me. In this valley of
the Caracones wee found more store of people then in any other
part of the Countrey which wee had passed, and great store of
tillage.
<span class="sidenote">Valle del Senor.</span>
But I vnderstood that there was store there
of in another valley called The Lords valley, which I
woulde not disturbe with force, but sent thither Melchior
Diaz with wares of exchange to procure some, and to giue
the sayde Maiz to the Indians our friendes which wee brought
with vs, and to some others that had lost their cattell in the way,
and were not able to carry their victuals so farre which they
brought from Culiacan. It pleased God that wee gate some
small quantitie of Maiz with this traffique, whereby certaine
Indians were relieued and some Spanyards.</p>

<p>And by that time that wee were come to this valley of the
<!--117.png-->
<span class="pagenum">120</span>
Caracones, some tenne or twelve of our horses were
dead through wearinesse: for being ouercharged
with great burdens, and hauing but little meate, they
could not endure the trauaile. Likewise some of
our Negros and some of our Indians dyed here:
which was no small wante vnto vs for the performance
of our enterprise.
<span class="sidenote">The valley de los Caracones distant fiue dayes

They tolde me that this valley
of the Coracones is fiue dayes journey from the
Westerne Sea.
<span class="sidenote">Seuen or eight Isles, which are the Isles of
California. A ship scene on the sea coast.</span>
I sent for the Indians of the Sea
coast to vnderstand their estate, and while I stayed
for them the horses rested: and I stayed there foure
dayes, in which space the Indians of the Sea coast
came vnto mee: which told mee, that, two dayes
sayling from their coast of the Sea, there were seuen or eight
Islands right ouer against them well inhabited with people, but
badly furnished with victuals, and were a rude people: And
they told mee, that they had seene a Shippe passe by not farre
from the shore: which I wote not what to thinke whether it were
one of those that went to discouer the Countrey, or else a Ship of
the Portugals.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 2.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">They come to Chichilticale: after they had rested themselues
two dayes there, they enter into a Countrey very barren of
victuals, and hard to trauaile for thirtie leagues, beyond
which they found a Countrey very pleasant, and a riuer
called Rio del Lino, they fight with the Indians being
assaulted by them, and with victorie vanquishing their
citie, they relieued themselues of their pinching hunger.</div>

<p>I Departed from the Caracones, and alwayes kept by the Sea
coast as neere as I could iudge, and in very deed I still found
my selfe the farther off: in such sort that when I arriued at
Chichilticale I found myselfe tenne dayes iourney from the Sea:
and the father prouinciall sayd that it was onely but fiue leagues
distance, and that hee had seene the same. Wee all conceiued
great griefe and were not a little confounded, when we saw that
wee found euery thing contrary to the information which he had
giuen your Lordship.</p>

<p>The Indians of Chichilticale say, that if at any time they goe
<!--118.png-->
<span class="pagenum">121</span>
to the Sea for fish, and other things that they carry, they goe
trauersing, and are tenne dayes iournie in going thither. And I
am of opinion that the information which the Indians giue me
should be true. The sea returneth toward the West right ouer
against the Coracones the space of tenne or twelue leagues.
<span class="sidenote">The Chichilticale is indeede but in 28.

Where I found that your Lordships ships were seene, which went
to discouer the hauen of Chichilticale, which father Marcus of
Ni&ccedil;a sayd to bee in fiue and thirtie degrees. God
knoweth what griefe of mind I haue sustained: because
I am in doubt that some mishappe is fallen vnto
them: and if they follow the coast, as they sayde they
would, as long as their victuals last which they carry with them,
whereof I left them store in Culiacan, and if they be not fallen
into some misfortune, I hope well in God that by this they haue
made some good discouerie, and that in this respect their long
staying out may be pardoned.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The 24. of Iune.</span>
I rested myselfe two dayes in Chichilticale, and to haue done
well I should haue stayed longer, in respect that here wee
found our horses so tyred; but because wee wanted victuals,
we had no leasure to rest any longer: I entred the
confines of the desert Countrey on Saint Iohns eue,
and to refresh our former trauailes, the first dayes we founde no
grasse, but worser way of mountaines and badde passages, then
wee had passed alreadie: and the horses being tired, were
greatly molested therewith: so that in this last desert we lost
more horses than we had lost before: and some of my Indians
which were our friends dyed, and one Spanyard whose name was
Spinosa; and two Negroes, which dyed with eating certaine
herbes for lacke of victuals. From this place I sent before mee
one dayes iourney the master of the fielde Don Garcia Lopez de
Cardenas with fifteene horses to discouer the Countrey, and prepare
our way: wherein hee did like himselfe, and according to
the confidence which your Lordship reposed in him. And well
I wote he fayled not to do his part: for as I have informed your
Lordship, it is most wicked way, at least thirtie leagues and more,
because they are inaccessible mountaines.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A godly and fruitfull countrey found.</span>
But after wee had passed these thirtie leagues, wee
found fresh riuers, and grasse like that of Castile, and
specially of that sort which we call Scaramoio, many
Nutte trees and Mulberrie trees but the Nutte trees
differ from those of Spayne in the leafe: and there was Flaxe,
<!--119.png-->
<span class="pagenum">122</span>
but chiefly neere the bankes of a certayne riuer which therefore
we called El Rio del Lino, that is to say, the riuer of Flaxe: wee
found no Indians at all for a dayes trauaile, but afterward foure
Indians came out vnto vs in peaceable maner, saying that they
were sent euen to that desert place to signifie vnto vs that wee
were welcome, and that the next day all the people would come
out to meet vs on the way with victuals: and the master of the
fielde gaue them a crosse, willing them to signifie to those of
their citie that they should not feare, and they should rather let
the people stay in their houses, because I came onely in the
name of his Majestie to defend and ayd them.</p>

<p>And this done, Fernando Aluarado returned to aduertise mee
that certaine Indians were come vnto them in peaceable maner,
and that two of them stayed for my comming with the master of
the fielde. Whereupon I went unto them and gave them beades
and certaine short clokes, willing them to returne vnto their citie,
and bid them to stay quiet in their houses and feare nothing.
<span class="sidenote">A wise forecast.</span>
And this done I sent the master of the field to search
whether there were any bad passage which the
Indians might keepe against vs, and that hee should
take and defend it vntill the next day that I shoulde come thither.
<span class="sidenote">The treason of the Indians.</span>
So hee went, and found in the way a very bad passage, where
wee might haue sustayned very great harme: wherefore there
hee seated himselfe with his company that were with him: and
that very night the Indians came to take that passage
to defend it, and finding it taken, they assaulted our
men there, and as they tell mee, they assaulted them
like valiant men; although in the ende they retired and fledde
away; for the master of the fielde was watchfull, and was in order
with his company: the Indians in token of retreate sounded on
a certaine small trumpet, and did no hurt among
the Spanyards.
<span class="sidenote">Great forecast and diligence of the
Campe-master.</span>
The very same night the master of
the fielde certified mee hereof. Whereupon the
next day in the best order that I could I departed
in so great want of victuall, that I thought that if
wee should stay one day longer without foode, wee should all
perish for hunger, especially the Indians, for among vs all we
had not two bushels of corne: wherefore it behooued mee to
pricke forward without delay. The Indians here and there made
fires, and were answered againe afarre off as orderly as wee for
<!--120.png-->
<span class="pagenum">123</span>
our liues could haue done, to giue their fellowes vnderstanding,
how wee marched and where we arriued.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">They arriue at the citie of Cibola.</span>
Assoone as I came within sight of this citie of Grenada, I
sent Don Garcias Lopez Campe-master, frier Daniel,
and frier Luys, and Fernando Vermizzo somewhat
before with certaine horsemen, to seeke the Indians
and to aduertise them that our comming was not to hurt them,
but to defend them in the name of the Emperour our Lord,
according as his maiestie had giuen vs in charge: which message
was deliuered to the inhabitants of that countrey by
an interpreter.
<span class="sidenote">The arrogancie of the people of Cibola.</span>
But they like arrogant people made
small account thereof; because we seemed very few
in their eyes, and that they might destroy vs without
any difficultie: and they strooke frier Luys with an arrow on the
gowne, which by the grace of God did him no harme.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Commandement to vse gentlenesse to the
Sauages.</span>
In the meane space I arriued with all the rest of the horsemen,
and footemen, and found in the fieldes a great sort of the
Indians which beganne to shoote at vs with their arrowes: and
because I would obey your will and the commaund
of the Marques, I woulde not let my people charge
them, forbidding my company, which intreated mee
that they might set vpon them, in any wise to prouoke
them, saying that that which the enemies did was
nothing, and that it was not meete to set vpon so fewe people.
On the other side the Indians perceiuing that we stirred not,
tooke great stomacke and courage vnto them: insomuch that
they came hard to our horses heeles to shoote at vs with their
arrowes. Whereupon seeing that it was now time to stay no
longer, and that the friers also were of the same opinion, I set
vpon them without any danger: for suddenly they fled part to
the citie which was neere and well fortified; and other vnto the
field, which way they could shift: and some of the Indians were
slaine, and more had beene if I would haue suffered them to
haue bene pursued.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">There were 800 men within the towne. Gomara, Hist.
gen. cap. 213.</span>
But considering that hereof wee might reape but small profite,
because the Indians that were withoute, were fewe,
and those which were retired into the citie, with them
which stayed within at the first were many, where the
victuals were whereof wee had so great neede, I
assembled my people, and diuided them as I thought
best to assault the citie, and I compassed it about:
<!--121.png-->
<span class="pagenum">124</span>
and because the famine which wee sustained suffered no delay
my selfe with certaine of these gentlemen and souldiers put our
selues on foote, and commaunded that the crossebowes and
harquebusiers shoulde giue the assault, and shoulde beate the
enemies from the walles, that they might not hurt vs, and I
assaulted the walles on one side, where they told me there was a
scaling ladder set vp, and that there was one gate but the
crossebowmen suddenly brake the strings of their bowes, and the
harquebusiers did nothing at all: for they came thither so weake
and feeble, that scarcely they coulde stand on their feete: and
by this meanes the people that were aloft on the wals to defend
the towne were no way hindered from doing vs all the mischiefe
they could:
<span class="sidenote">They defend the wals with stones like those of
Hochelaga.</span>
so that twise they stroke mee to the
ground with infinite number of great stones, which
they cast downe: and if I had not beene defended
with an excellent good headpiece which I ware, I
thinke it had gone hardly with mee: neuerthelesse
my companie tooke mee vp with two small wounds in the face,
and an arrowe sticking in my foote, and many blowes with
stones on my armes and legges, and thus I went out of the
battell very weake. I thinke that if Don Garcias Lopez de
Cardenas the second time that they strooke mee to the ground
had not succoured mee with striding ouer mee like a good
knight, I had beene in farre greater danger then I was. But it
pleased God that the Indians yeelded themselues vnto vs, and
that this citie was taken: and such store of Maiz was found
there in, as our necessitie required. The Master of the fielde,
and Don Pedro de Touar, and Fernando de Aluarado, and Paul
de Melgosa Captaines of the footemen escaped with certaine
knocks with stones: though none of them were wounded with
arrowes, yet Agoniez Quarez was wounded in one arme with the
shot of an arrowe, and one Torres a townesman of Panuca was
shot in the face with another, and two footemen more had two
small woundes with arrowes. And because my armour was
gilded and glittering, they all layd load on mee, and therefore I
was more wounded then the rest, not that I did more then they,
or put my selfe forwarder then the rest, for all these Gentlemen
and souldiers carried themselues as manfully as was looked for
at their hands. I am nowe well recouered I thanke God,
although somewhat bruised with stones. Likewise in the
skirmish which wee had in the fieldes, two or three other
<!--122.png-->
<span class="pagenum">125</span>
souldiers were hurt, and three horses slaine, one of Don Lopez,
the other of Viliega and the third of Don Alonso Manrique, and
seuen or eight other horses were wounded; but both the men
and horses are whole and sound.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Of the situation and state of the seuen cities called the kingdome
of Cibola, and of the customes and qualities of those
people, and of the beasts which are found there.</div>

<p>It remaineth now to certifie your Honour of the seuen cities,
and of the kingdomes and prouinces whereof the Father
prouincial made report vnto your Lordship. And to bee briefe,
I can assure your honour, he sayd the trueth in nothing that
he reported, but all was quite contrary, sauing only the names of
the cities, and great houses of stone: for although they be not
wrought with Turqueses, nor with lyme, nor brickes, yet are they
very excellent good houses of three or foure or fiue lofts high,
wherein are good lodgings and faire chambers with lathers instead
of staires, and certaine cellers vnder the ground very good and
paued, which are made for winter, they are in manner like
stooues: and the lathers which they have for their houses are all
in a maner mooueable and portable, which are taken away and
set downe when they please, and they are made of two pieces of
wood with their steppes, as ours be. The seuen cities are seuen
small townes, all made with these kinde of houses that I speake
of: and they stand all within foure leagues together, and they
are called the kingdome of Cibola, and euery one of them haue
their particular name and none of them is called Cibola, but
altogether they are called Cibola. And this towne which I call
a citie, I haue named Granada, as well because it is somewhat
like vnto it, as also in remembrance of your lordship. In this
towne where I now remain, there may be some two hundred
houses, all compassed with walles, and I think that with the rest
of the houses which are not so walled, they may be together fiue
hundred. There is another towne neere this, which is one of the
seuen, and it is somewhat bigger than this, and another of the same
bignesse that this is of, and the other foure are somewhat lesse:
<!--123.png-->
<span class="pagenum">126</span>
and I send them all painted vnto your lordship with
the voyage.
<span class="sidenote">A painter necessarie in a new discouery.</span>
And the parchment wherein the
picture is, was found here with other parchments.
The people of this towne seeme vnto me of a reasonable
stature, and wittie, yet they seeme not to bee such as they
should be, of that iudgment and wit to builde these houses in
such sort as they are. For the most part they goe all naked,
except their priuie parts which are couered: and they haue
painted mantles like those which I send vnto your Lordship.
They haue no cotton wooll growing, because the countrey is
colde, yet they weare mantels thereof as your honour may see by
the shewe thereof: and true it is that there was found in their
houses certaine yarne made of cotton wooll.
<span class="sidenote">Store of Turqueses.</span>
They weare their
haire on their heads like those of Mexico, and they are well nurtured
and condicioned: And they haue Turqueses I
thinke good quantitie, which with the rest of the
goods which they had, except their corne, they had
conueyed away before I came thither: for I found no women
there, nor no youth vnder fifteene yeeres olde, nor no olde folkes
aboue sixtie, sauing two or three olde folkes, who stayed behinde
to gouerne all the rest of the youth and men of warre. There
were found in a certaine paper two poynts of Emralds, and
certaine small stones broken which are in colour somewhat like
Granates very bad, and other stones of Christall, which I gaue
one of my seruants to lay vp to send them to your lordship, and
hee hath lost them as hee telleth me. We found heere Guinie
cockes, but fewe. The Indians tell mee in all these seuen cities,
that they eate them not, but that they keepe them onely for their
feathers. I beleeue them not, for they are excellent good, and
greater then those of Mexico. The season which is in this
countrey, and the temperature of the ayre is like that of Mexico:
or sometime it is hotte, and sometime it raineth; but hitherto I
neuer sawe it raine, but once there fell a little showre with winde,
as they are woont to fell in Spaine.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Gomora hist. gen. Cap. 213. sayth that the colde is
by reason of the high mountaines.</span>
The snow and cold are woont to be great, for so say the inhabitants
of the Countrey: and it is very likely so to bee, both
in respect to the maner of the Countrey, and by the
fashion of their houses, and their furres and other
things which this people have to defend them from
colde. There is no kind of fruit nor trees of fruite.
The Countrey is all plaine, and is on no side
<!--124.png-->
<span class="pagenum">127</span>
mountainous: albeit there are some hillie and bad passages.
There are small store of Foules: the cause whereof is the
colde, and because the mountains are not neere. Heere
is no great store of wood, because they haue wood for their fuell
sufficient foure leagues off from a wood of small Cedars.
There is most excellent grasse within a quarter of a league hence,
for our horses as well to feede them in pasture, as to mow and
make hay, whereof wee stoode in great neede, because our horses
came hither so weak and feeble. The victuals which the people of
this countrey haue, is Maiz, whereof they haue great store, and
also small white Pease: and Venison, which by all likelyhood
they feede vpon, (though they say no) for wee found many skinnes
of Deere, of Hares, and Conies. They eate the best cakes that
euer I sawe, and euery body generally eateth of them. They
haue the finest order and way to grinde that we euer saw in any
place. And one Indian woman of this countrey will grinde as
muche as foure women of Mexico. They have most excellent
salte in kernell, which they fetch from a certaine lake
a dayes iourney from hence.
<span class="sidenote">The Westerne sea within 150 leagues from
Cibola.</span>
They haue no knowledge among them of the North Sea, nor of the
Westerne Sea, neither can I tell your lordship to
which wee bee neerest; But in reason they should
seeme to be nearest to the Westerne Sea: and at the least I
thinke I am an hundred and fiftie leagues from thence: and the
Northerne Sea should bee much further off. Your lordship may
see how broad the land is here. Here are many sorts of beasts,
as Beares, Tigers, Lions, Porkespicks, and certaine Sheep as
bigge as an horse, with very great hornes and little tailes, I haue
seene their hornes so bigge, that it is a wonder to behold their
greatnesse. Here are also wilde goates whose heads likewise I
haue seene, and the pawes of Beares, and the skins of wilde
Bores. There is game of Deere, Ounces, and very great Stagges:
and all men are of opinion that there are some bigger then that
beast which your Lordship bestowed upon me, which once
belonged to Iohn Melaz.
<span class="sidenote">Oxe hides dressed and painted very
cunningly.</span>
They trauell eight dayes iourney vnto
certaine plaines lying toward the North Sea. In
this countrey there are certaine skinnes well dressed,
and they dresse them and paint them where they kill
their Oxen, for so they say themselues.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Of the state and qualities of the kingdomes of Totonteac,

Marcus. The conference which they haue with the
Indians of the citie of Granada which they had taken,
which had fiftie yeres past foreseene the comming of the
Christians into their countrey. The relation which they
haue of other seuen cities, whereof Tucano is the principall,
and how he sent to discouer them. A present of
divers things had in these countreys sent vnto the
Viceroy Mendo&ccedil;a by Vasques de Coronado.</div>

<p>The kingdome of Totonteac so much extolled by the Father
prouinciall, which sayde that there were such wonderfull things
there, and such great matters, and that they made cloth there,
the Indians say is an hotte lake, about which are fiue or sixe
houses: and that there were certaine other, but that
they are ruinated by warre. The kingdome of
Marata is not to be found, neither haue the Indians
any knowledge thereof.
<span class="sidenote">Tadouac seemeth because it is a lake, and endeth
in ac to haue some affinitie herewith.</span>
The kingdome of Acus is
one onely small citie, where they gather cotton which
is called Acucu. And I say that this is a towne.
For Acus with an aspiration nor without is no word
of the countrey. And because I gesse that they would deriue
Acucu of Acus, I say that it is this towne whereinto the kingdom
of Acus is conuerted. Beyond this towne they say there are
other small townes which are neere to a riuer which I haue seene
and haue had report of by the relation of the Indians. I would
to God I had better newes to write vnto your lordship: neuerthelesse
I must say the trueth: And as I wrote to your lordship
from Culiacan, I am now to aduertise your honour as wel of the
good as of the bad. Yet this I would haue to bee assured, that
if all the riches and the treasures of the world were heere, I could
haue done no more in the seruice of his Maiestie and of your
lordshippe, then I haue done in comming hither whither you
haue sent mee, my selfe and my companions carrying our victuals
vpon our shoulders and vpon our horses three hundred leagues;
and many dayes going on foote trauailing ouer hills and
rough mountains, with other troubles which I cease to mention,
<!--126.png-->
<span class="pagenum">129</span>
neither purpose I to depart unto the death, if it please his
Maiestie and your lordship that it shall be so.</p>

<p>Three dayes after this citie was taken, certaine Indians of
these people came to offer mee peace, and brought mee certaine
Turqueses and badde mantles, and I received them in his
Maiesties name with all the good speaches that I could deuise,
certifying them of the purpose of my comming into this countrey,
which is in the name of his Maiestie, and by the commaundment
of your Lordship, that they and all the rest of the people of this
prouince should become Christians, and should knowe the true
God for their Lorde, and receiue his Maiestie for their King and
earthly Soueraigne: And herewithall they returned to their
houses, and suddenly the next day they set in order all their
goods and substance, their women and children, and fled to the
hilles, leauing their townes as it were abandoned, wherein remained
very fewe of them.
<span class="sidenote">A citie greater than Granada.</span>
When I sawe this, within eight or tenne
dayes after being recouered of my woundes, I went
to the citie, which I sayde to be greater then this
where I am, and found there some fewe of them, to
whom I sayde that they should not bee afrayd, and that they
should call their gouernour vnto mee: Howbeit forasmuch as I
can learne or gather, none of them hath any gouernour: for I
sawe not there any chiefe house, whereby any preeminence of
one ouer another might bee gathered. After this an olde man
came, which sayd that hee was their lord, with a piece of a
mantle made of many pieces, with whom I reasoned that small
while that hee stayed with mee, and hee sayd that within three
dayes after, hee and the rest of the chiefe of that towne would
come and visite mee, and giue order what course should bee
taken with them. Which they did: for they brought mee certaine
mantles and some Turqueses. I aduised them to come
downe from their holdes, and to returne with their wiues and
children to their houses, and to become Christians, and that
they would acknowledge the Emperours maiestie for their King
and lorde. And euen to this present they keepe in those
strong holdes their women and children, and all the
goods which they haue.
<span class="sidenote">Two tables painted by the Indians, one of beasts

I commaunded them that
they should paint mee out a cloth of all the beastes
which they knowe in their countrey: And such

mee two cloths, one of their beastes, another of
<!--127.png-->
<span class="pagenum">130</span>
their birdes and fishes.
<span class="sidenote">An old prophecie that those parts should be
subdued by Christians.</span>
They say that they will bring their
children, that our religious men may instruct them, and that
they desire to knowe our lawe: And they assure vs,
that aboue fiftie yeeres past it was prophecied among
them, that a certaine people like vs should come,
and from that part that wee came from, and that
they should subdue all that countrey.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">They worship the water.</span>
That which these Indians worship as farre as hitherto wee can
learne, is the water: for they say it causeth their
corne to growe, and maintaineth their life; and that
they know none other reason, but that their ancesters
did so. I haue sought by all meanes possible to learne of the
inhabitants of these townes, whether they haue any knowledge of
other people, countreys and cities:
<span class="sidenote">Seuen cities farre from Granada.</span>
And they tell mee
of seuen cities which are farre distant from this place,
which are like vnto these, though they haue not
houses like vnto these but they are of earth, and small: and
that among them much cotton is gathered. The chiefe of these
townes whereof they haue any knowledge, they say is called
Tucano: and they gaue mee no perfect knowledge of the rest.
And I thinke they doe not tell me the trueth, imagining that of
necessitie I must speedily depart from them, and returne home.
But herein they shall soone finde themselues deceiued. I sent
Don Pedro de Touar with his companie of footemen and with
certaine other horsemen to see this towne: And I would not
haue despatched this packet vnto your lordship, vntill I had
knowen what this towne was, if I had thought that within twelue
or fifteene dayes I might haue had newes from him: for hee
will stay in this iourney thirtie dayes at least. And hauing
examined that the knowledge hereof is of small importance, and
that the colde and the waters approch: I thought it my duety to
doe according as your lordship gaue me charge in your instructions,
which is, that immediatly vpon mine arriuall here, I should
signifie so much vnto your lordship, and so I doe, sending withall
the bare relation of that which I haue seene. I haue determined
to send round about the countrey from hence to haue
knowledge of all things, and rather to suffer all extremitie, then
to leaue this enterprise to serue his maiestie, if I may find any
thing wherein I may performe it, and not to omit any diligence
therein, vntill your lordship send mee order what I shall doe.
Wee haue great want of pasture:
<span class="sidenote">The Spaniards victualling in discoueries.</span>
and your Lordship also shall
<!--128.png-->
<span class="pagenum">131</span>
vnderstand, that among all those which are here, there
is not one pound of raisins, nor suger, nor oyle, nor
any wine, saue only one pinte which is saued, to say
Masse: for all is spent and spilt by the way. Now
your lordship may prouide vs what you thinke needefull. And
if your honour meane to send vs cattell, your lordship must
vnderstand that they will bee a sommer in comming vnto vs: for
they will not be able to come vnto vs any sooner.
<span class="sidenote">A garment excellently imbroidered with needle
worke.</span>
I would haue
sent your lordshippe with this dispatch many musters of things
which are in this countrey: but the way is so long and rough,
that it is hard for me to doe so: neuerthelesse I send you twelue
small mantles, such as the people of the countrey are
woont to weare, and a certaine garment also, which
seemeth vnto me to bee well made: I kept the same,
because it seemed to mee to bee excellent well
wrought, because I beleeue that no man euer sawe
any needle worke in these Indies, except it were since the
Spaniards inhabited the same. I send your Lordshippe also two
clothes painted with the beasts of this country, although as I
haue sayde, the picture be very rudely done, because the
painter spent but one day in drawing of the same. I haue
seene other pictures on the walles of the houses of this citie
with farre better proportion, and better made. I send your
honour one Oxe-hide, certaine Turqueses, and two eare-rings of
the same, and fifteene combes of the Indians, and certain tablets
set with these Turqueses, and two small baskets made of wicker,
whereof the Indians haue great store. I send your Lordship
also two rolles which the women in these parts are woont to
weare on their heads when they fetch water from their welles, as
wee vse to doe in Spaine. And one of these Indian women
with one of these rolles on her head, will carie a pitcher of water
without touching the same vp a lather. I send you also a muster
of the weapons wherewith these people are woont to fight, a
buckler, a mace, a bowe, and certaine arrowes, among which are
two with points of bones, the like whereof, as these conquerours
say, haue neuer beene seene. I can say nothing vnto your
lordshippe touching the apparell of their women. For the
Indians keepe them so carefully from vs, that hitherto I haue not
seene any of them, sauing only two olde women, and these had
two long robes downe to the foote open before, and girded to
them, and they are buttoned with certaine cordons of cotton.
<!--129.png-->
<span class="pagenum">132</span>
I requested the Indians to giue me one of these robes, which
they ware, to send your honour the same, seeing they would not
shewe mee their women. And they brought mee two mantles
which are these, which I send you as it were painted:
they haue two pendents like the women of Spaine,
which hang somewhat ouer their shoulders.
<span class="sidenote">The death of Stephan the Negro.</span>
The
death of the Negro is most certaine: for here are
many of the things found which hee carried with him: And the
Indians tell me that they killed him here, because the Indians of
Chichilticale tolde them that hee was a wicked villaine, and not
like vnto the Christians: because the Christians kill no women:
and hee killed women: and also he touched their women, which
the Indians loue more then themselues; therefore they determined
to kill him: But they did it not after such sort as was reported,
for they killed none of the rest of those that came with
him: neither slewe they the young lad which was with him
of the prouince of Petatlan, but they tooke him and kept him in
safe custodie vntill nowe. And when I sought to haue him, they
excused themselues two or three dayes to giue him mee, telling
mee that hee was dead, and sometimes that the Indians of Acucu
had carried him away. But in conclusion when I tolde them
that I should bee very angry if they did not giue him mee, they
gaue him vnto me. Hee is an interpreter, for though
hee cannot well speake their language, yet hee vnderstandeth
the same very well.
<span class="sidenote">Gold and siluer found in Cibola.</span>
In this place there
is found some quantitie of golde and siluer, which those which
are skilful in minerall matters esteeme to be very good. To this
houre I could neuer learne of these people from whence they
haue it: And I see they refuse to tell mee the trueth in all
things imagining, as I haue sayde, that in short I would depart
hence, but I hope in God they shall no longer excuse themselues.
I beseech your lordship to certifie his Maiestie of the successe of
his voyage. For seeing wee haue no more then that which is aforesayd,
and vntil such time as it please God that wee finde that
which wee desire, I meane not to write my selfe. Our Lorde
God keepe and preserue your excellencie.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2b">The rest of this voyage to Acuco, Liguex, Cicuic, and Quiuira,
and vnto the Westerne Ocean, is thus written in the
generall historie of the West Indies by Francis Lopez de
Gomera, Chap. 214.</div>

<p>Because they would not returne to Mexico without doing something,
nor with emptie hands, they agreed to passe further into
the countrey, which was tolde them to bee better and better. So
they came to Acuco a towne vpon an exceeding strong hill.
<span class="sidenote">The Westerne sea discouered.</span>
And
from thence Don Garcias Lopez de Cardenas with his
companie of horsemen went vnto the Sea: and Francis
Vasques went to Tiguex, which standeth on the banke
of a great riuer. There they had newes of Axa and Quiuira.
There they sayde was a King whose name was Tartatrax, with a
long beard, horie headed, and rich, which was girded with a
Bracamart, which prayed vpon a payre of beades, which worshipped
a Crosse of golde, and the image of a woman, the Queene of
heauen. This newes did greatly reioyce and cheere vp the armie:
although some thought it to bee false, and the report of the Friers.
They determined to goe thither, with intention to winter in so
rich a countrey as that was reported to bee. One night the
Indians ranne away, and in the morning they found thirtie horses
dead, which put the armie in feare. In their iourney they burnt
a certaine towne: And in another towne which they assaulted,
they killed certaine Spaniards, and wounded fiftie horses and the
inhabitants drewe into their towne Francis de Ouando wounded
or dead, to eate and sacrifice him as they thought, or peraduenture
to see more perfectly, what maner of them the Spaniards were:
for there was not found there any signe of sacrificing men. Our
people layde siege vnto the towne, but could not take it in more
then fiue and fortie dayes space. The townesmen that were
besieged, dranke snowe in stead of water: and seeing themselues
forlorne they made a fire, wherein they cast their mantles, feathers,
Turqueses and precious things, that those strangers might not
enioy them. They issued out in a squadron with their women
and children in the middest, to make way by force, and to saue
themselues, but fewe escaped the edge of our swordes and the
horses, and a certaine riuer which was neere the towne. Seuen
Spaniards were slaine in this conflict, and fourescore were wounded,
and many horses: whereby a man may see of what force resolution
<!--131.png-->
<span class="pagenum">134</span>
is in necessitie. Many Indians returned to the towne with the
women and children, and defended themselues, vntill our men
set fire on the towne. In this countrey there are melons, and
white and redde cotton, whereof they make farre larger mantels,
then in other parts of the Indies. From Tigues they went in
foure dayes iourney to Cicuic, which is a small towne, and foure
leagues from thence they met with a new kind of oxen wild and
fierce, whereof the first day they killed fourescore, which sufficed
the armie with flesh. From Cicuic they went to Quiuira, which
after their accompt, is almost three hundred leagues distant,
through mighty plaines, and sandie heathes so smooth, and wearisome,
and bare of wood, that they made heapes of oxe-dung for
want of stones and trees, that they might not lose themselues at their
returne: for three horses were lost on that plaine, and one Spaniard,
which went from his companie on hunting. All that way and plaines
are as full of crookebacked oxen, as the mountaine Serena in Spaine
is of sheepe: but there is no people but such as keepe those cattell.
They were a great succour for the hunger and want of bread
which our people stoode in. One day it rayned in that plaine a
great showre of haile, as bigge as Orenges, which caused many
teares, weakenesse, and vowes. At length they came to Quiuira
and found Tatarrax, whome they sought, an hoarie headed man,
naked, and with a iewell of copper hanging at his necke, which
was all his riches. The Spaniards seeing the false report of so
famous riches, returned to Tiguex, without seeing either crosse
or shew of Christianitie: and from thence to Mexico.
<span class="sidenote">The Spaniards would haue inhabited the
countrey.</span>
In the ende of March of the yeere 1542. Francis
Vasquez fell from his horse in Tiguex, and with the
fall fell out of his wits, and became madde. Which
some tooke to bee for griefe, and others thought it to
be but counterfeited: for they were much offended with him,
because hee peopled not the countrey.</p>

<p>Quiuira is in fortie degrees: it is a temperate countrey, and
hath very good waters, and much grasse, plummes, mulberries,
nuts, melons and grapes, which ripen very well. There is no
cotton: and they apparell themselues with oxe-hides and deeres
skinnes. They sawe shippes on the sea coast, which bare Alcatrarzes
or Pellicanes of golde and siluer in their prows, and
were laden with marchandises, and they thought them to bee of
Cathaya, and China, because they shewed our men by signes that
they had sayled thirtie dayes.</p>

<p><!--132.png--><span class="pagenum">135</span>
Frier Iohn de Padilla stayed behinde in Tigues, with another
of his companions called Frier Francis, and returned to Quiuira,
with some dozen Indians of Mechuacan, and with Andrew de
Campo a Portugall, the gardiner of Francis de Solis: He tooke
with him horses and mules with prouision. He tooke sheepe and
hennes of Castile, and ornaments to say Masse withall. The
people of Quiuira slewe the Friers, and the Portugall escaped
with certaine Indians of Mechuacan. Who albeit at that time
he escaped death, yet could hee not free himselfe out of captiuitie:
for by and by after they caught him againe. But ten
moneths after he was taken captiue, hee fled away with a couple
of dogs. As hee trauiled, hee blessed the people with a crosse,
whereunto they offered much, and wheresoeuer hee came, they giue
him almes, lodging, and foode.
<span class="sidenote">Andrew de Campo trauailed from Quiuira to
Panuco.</span>
He came to the
countrey of the Chichimechas and arriued at Panuco.
When he came to Mexico, hee ware his haire very
long, and his beard tyed up in a lace, and reported
strange things of the lands, riuers and mountaines
that he had passed.</p>

<p>It grieued Don Antonio de Mendoca very much that the army
returned home: for he had spent aboue threescore
thousand pesos of golde in the enterprise, and ought a
great part thereof still.
<span class="sidenote">The cause why the Spaniards peopled not in
Cibola.</span>
Many sought to haue dwelt
there; but Francis Vasquez de Coronado, which was
rich, and lately married to a faire wife, would not
consent, saying, that they could not maintaine nor defend themselues
in so poore a countrey, and so farre from succour. They
trauailed aboue nine hundred leagues in this countrey.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2"><a name="a286" id="a286"></a>The foresayd Francis Lopez de Gomara in his generall historie of
the West Indies, Chap. 215. writeth in maner following of
certaine great and strange beasts neuer seene nor heard of
in our knowen world of Asia, Europe, and Africa: which
somewhat resembling our oxen, hauing high bunches on
their backes like those on the backes of Camels, are therefore
called by him Vacas corcobados, that is to say, Crooke-backed
oxen, being very deformed and terrible in shewe,
and fierce by nature: which notwithstanding for foode,
apparell, and other necessarie vses, are most seruiceable
and beneficiall to the inhabitants of those countreys. He
reporteth also in the same chapter of certaine strange
sheepe as bigge as horses, and of dogs which vse to carie
burthens of 50. pound weight vpon their backes.</div>

<p>All the way betweene Cicuic and Quiuira is a most plaine
soyle, without trees and stones, and hath but fewe and small
townes.
<span class="sidenote">These are much like the people that Captain
Frobisher brought into England from Meta Incognita.</span>
The men clothe and shooe themselues with
lether; and the women which are esteemed for their
long lockes, couer their heads and secrets with the
same. They haue no bread of any kinde of graine, as
they say: which I account a very great matter.
Their chiefest foode is flesh, and that oftentimes they
eate raw, either of custome or for lacke of wood.
They eate the fatte as they take it out of the Oxe,
and drinke the blood hotte, and die not therewithall, though the
ancient writers say that it killeth, as Empedocles and others
affirmed, they drinke it also colde dissolued in water. They
seeth not the flesh for lacke of pots, but rost it, or to say more
properly, warme it at a fire of Oxe-dung: when they eate, they
chawe their meate but little, and rauen vp much, and holding the
flesh with their teeth, they cut it with rasors of stone, which
seemeth to be great bestialitie: but such is their maner of liuing
and fashion. They goe together in companies, and mooue from
one place to another, as the wilde Moores of Barbarie called
Alarbes doe, following the seasons and the pasture after their
Oxen.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The description of the oxen of Quiuira.</span>
These Oxen are of the bignesse and colour of our
Bulles, but their hornes are not so great. They haue
a great bunch vpon their fore shoulders, and more
haire on their fore part then on their hinder part:
<!--134.png-->
<span class="pagenum">137</span>
and it is like wooll. They haue as it were an horse-manne vpon
their backe bone, and much haire and very long from the knees
downward. They haue great tuffes of haire hanging downe their
foreheads, and it seemeth that they haue beardes, because of the
great store of haire hanging downe at their chinnes and throates.
The males haue very long tailes, and a great knobbe or flocke at
the end: so that in some respect they resemble the Lion, and
in some other the Camell. They push with their hornes,
they runne, they ouertake and kill an horse when they are
in their rage and anger. Finally, it is a foule and fierce
beast of countenance and forme of bodie. The horses
fledde from them, either because of their deformed shape,
or else because they had neuer seene them. Their
masters haue no other riches nor substance: of them
they eat, they drink, they apparel, they shooe themselues:
and of their hides they make many things, as houses, shooes,
apparell and ropes: of their bones they make bodkins: of their
sinewes and haire, threed: of their hornes, mawes, and bladders,
vessels; of their dung, fire: and of their calues-skinnes, budgets,
wherein they drawe and keepe water. To bee short, they make
so many things of them as they haue neede of, or as many as
suffice them in the vse of this life.</p>

<p>There are also in this countrey other beastes as big as horses,
which because they haue hornes and fine wool, they cal them
sheepe, and they say that euery horne of theirs weigheth is fiftie
pound weight.</p>

<p>There are also great dogs which will fight with a bull, and will
carrie fiftie pound weight in sackes when they goe on hunting, or
when they remooue from place to place with their flockes and
heards.</p>

in the yeere 1555. with diuers obseruations concerning
the state of the Countrey: And certaine accidents
touching himselfe.</div>

<p>Robert Tomson borne in the towne of Andouer in Hampshire
began his trauaile out of England in An. 1553. in the
moneth of March: who departing out of the citie of Bristoll in a
good ship called The barke yong, in companie of other Marchants
of the sayd citie, within 8. dayes after arriued at Lisbone in
Portugall, where the sayd Robert Tomson remained 15. dayes, at
the end of which he shipped himselfe for Spaine in the sayd
shippe, and within 4. dayes arriued in the bay of Cadiz in
Andalusia, which is vnder the kingdome of Spaine, and from
thence went vp to the citie of Siuil by land, which is 20. leagues,
and there hee repaired to one Iohn Fields house an English
Marchant, who had dwelt in the said city of Siuil 18. or 20.
yeres maried with wife and children: In whose house the said
Tomson remained by the space of one whole yeere or thereabout,
for two causes: The one to learn the Castillian tongue, the other
to see the orders of the countrey, and the customes of the
people. At the end of which time hauing seene the fleetes of
shippes come out of the Indies to that citie, with such great
<!--136.png-->
<span class="pagenum">139</span>
quantitie, of gold and siluer, pearles, precious stones, suger, hides,
ginger, and diuers other rich commodities, he did determine with
himselfe to seeke meanes and opportunitie to passe ouer to see
that rich countrey from whence such great quantitie of rich
commodities came. And it fell out that within short time after,
the said Iohn Field (where the sayd Tomson was lodged) did
determine to passe ouer into the West Indies, himselfe, with his
wife, children, and familie, and at the request of the sayde
Tomson, he purchased a licence of the King to passe into the
Indies, for himselfe, his wife and children, and among them also
for the sayde Tomson to passe with them: so that presently they
made preparation of victuall and other necessarie prouision for
the voyage. But the shippes which were prepared to perfourme
the voyage being all ready to depart, vpon certaine considerations
by the kings commandment were stayed and arrested till further
should bee knowen of the Kings pleasure. Whereupon the said
Iohn Field, with Robert Tomson departed out of Siuil and came
down to S. Lucar 15. leagues off, and seeing the stay made vpon
the ships of the said fleet, and being not assured when they
would depart, determined to ship themselues for the Iles of the
Canaries, which are 250. leagues from S. Lucar, and there to
stay till the said fleet should come thither: for that is continually
their port to make stay at 6. or 8. daies, to take in fresh water,
bread, flesh, and other necessaries.</p>

<p>So that in the moneth of February in An. 1555. the sayde
Robert Tomson with the said Iohn Field and his companie,
shipped themselues out of the towne of S. Lucar in a caruel of
the citie of Cadiz, and within 6. dayes they arriued at the port of
the Grand Canaria, where at our comming the ships that rode in
the said port began to cry out of all measure with loud voyces,
in so much that the castle which stood fast by began to shoot at
vs, and shot 6. or 7. shot at vs, and strooke downe our maine
maste, before we could hoise out our boat to goe on land, to
know what the cause of the shooting was, seeing that we were
Spanish ships, and were comming into his countrey. So that
being on lande, and complaining of the wrong and damage done
vnto us; they answered, that they had thought we had bene French
rouers, that had come into the said port to do some harme to the
ships that were there. For that 8. dayes past there went out of the
port a caruell much like vnto ours, laden with sugers and other
marchandise for Spaine and on the other side of the point of the
<!--137.png-->
<span class="pagenum">140</span>
sayd Iland, met with a Frenchman of warre, who tooke the said
caruell, and vnladed out of her into the said French ship both
men and goods. And being demanded of the said Spaniards
what other ships remained in the port whence they came, they
answered that there remained diuers other ships, and one
laden with sugers (as they were) and ready to depart for Spaine:
vpon the which newes the Frenchmen put 30. tall men of their
ship well appointed into the said caruel which they had taken,
and sent her backe againe to the said port from whence she had
departed the day before. And somewhat late towards the
euening came into the port, not shewing past 3. or 4. men, and
so came to an anker hard by the other ships that were in the
said port, and being seene by the castle and by the said ships,
they made no reconing of her, because they knew her, and
thinking that she had found contrary windes at the sea, or had
forgot something behinde them, they had returned backe againe
for the same, and so made no accompt of her, but let her alone
riding quietly among the other ships in the said port: So that
about midnight the said caruel with the Frenchmen in her
went aboord the other ship that lay hard by laden with
sugers, and droue the Spaniards that were in her vnder
hatches, and presently let slip her cables and ankers,
and set saile and carried her cleane away, and after this
sort deceiued them: And they thinking or fearing that we were
the like did shoote at vs as they did.
<span class="sidenote">English factors in the Grand Canaria.</span>
This being past, the next
day after our arriuall in the sayd port, wee did vnbarke our selues
and went on lande vp to the citie or head towne of the great
Canaria, where we remained 18. or 20. dayes: and
there found certaine Englishmen marchants servants
of one Anthony Hickman and Edward Castelin,
marchants of the citie of London that lay there in
traffique, of whom wee receiued great courtesie and much good
cheere. After the which 20. dayes being past, in the which we
had seene the countrey, the people, and the disposition thereof,
wee departed from thence, and passed to the next Ile of the
Canaries 18. leagues off; called Teneriffe, and being come on
land, went vp to the citie called La Laguna, where we remained
7. moneths, attending the comming of the whole fleete, which in
the ende came, and there hauing taken that which they had
neede of, wee shipped our selues in a ship of Cadiz, being one
of the saide fleete, which was belonging to an Englishman maried
<!--138.png-->
<span class="pagenum">141</span>
in the citie of Cadiz in Spaine, whose name was Iohn Sweeting,
and there came in the sayd ship for captain also an Englishman
maried in Cadiz, and sonne in law to the sayde Iohn Sweeting,
whose name was Leonard Chilton: there came also in the said
ship another Englishman which had beene a marchant of the citie
of Exeter, one of 50. yeeres or thereabout, whose name was
Ralph Sarre. So that we departed from the sayd Ilands in the
moneth of October the foresayd yeere, 8. ships in our companie,
and so directed our course towards the bay of Mexico, and by
the way towardes the Iland of S. Domingo, otherwise called
Hispaniola. So that within 32. dayes after we departed from
the Iles of Canaries wee arriued with our ship at the port of S.
Domingo, and went in ouer the barre where our ship knocked
her keele at her entrie: and there our ship rid before the towne,
where wee went on land, and refreshed our selues 16. dayes,
where we found no bread made of wheat, but biscuit brought
out of Spaine, and out of the bay of Mexico: for the countrey
it selfe doeth yeelde no kinde of bread to make graine withall.
But the bread they make there, is certaine cakes made of rootes
called Cassaui, which is something substantiall, but it hath but
an vnsauorie taste in the eating thereof. Flesh of beefe and
mutton they haue great store: for there are men that haue
10000. head of cattell, of oxen, bulles and kine, which they doe
keepe onely for the hides; for the quantitie of flesh is so great,
that they are not able to spend the hundreth part. Hogs flesh
is there good store, very sweete and sauorie, and so holesome,
that they giue it to sick folkes to eat in stead of hennes and
capons, although they haue good store of poultrie of that sort, as
also of Guinycocks and Guinyhens. At the time of our being
there, the citie of S. Domingo was not of aboue 500. housholds
of Spaniards, but of the Indians dwelling in the suburbs there
were more. The countrey is most part of the yere very hot, and
very ful of a kind of flies or gnats with long bils, which do pricke
and molest the people very much in the night when they are
asleepe, in pricking their faces and hands, and other parts of
their bodies that lie vncouered, and make them to swel wonderfully.
<span class="sidenote">Many of our men died of these wormes at the taking
of Puertorico.</span>
Also there is another kind of small worme
which creepeth into the soles of mens feet and
especially of the black Moores and children which
vse to go barefoot, and maketh their feet to grow as
big as a mans head, and doth so ake that it would
<!--139.png-->
<span class="pagenum">142</span>
make one run mad. They haue no remedy for the same, but
to open the flesh sometimes 3. or 4. inches and so dig them out.
The countrey yeeldeth great store of suger, hides of oxen, buls
and kine, ginger, Cana fistula and Salsa perilla: mines of siluer
and gold there are none, but in some riuers there is found some
smal quantitie of gold. The principal coine that they do trafique
withal in that place, is blacke money made of copper and brasse:
and this they say they do vse not for that they lacke money of
gold and siluer to trade withall out of the other parts of India,
but because if they should haue good money, the marchants that
deale with them in trade, would cary away their gold and siluer,
and let the countrey commodities lie still. And thus much for
S. Domingo. So we were comming from the yles of Canaries to
S. Domingo, and there staying vntil the moneth of December,
which was 3. moneths. About the beginning of Ianuary we
departed thence towards the bay of Mexico and new Spaine,
toward which we set our course, and so sailed 24. dayes till we
came within 15. leagues of S. Iohn de Vllua, which was the port
of Mexico of our right discharge: And being so neere our said
port, there rose a storme of Northerly windes, which came off
from Terra Florida, which caused vs to cast about into the sea,
againe, for feare least that night we should be cast vpon the
shoore before day did breake, and so put our selues in danger of
casting away: the winde and sea grew so foule and strong, that
within two houres after the storme began, eight ships that were
together were so dispersed, that we could not see one another.
One of the ships of our company being of the burthen of 500.
tun called the hulke of Carion, would not cast about to sea as
we did, but went that night with the land, thinking in the morning
to purchase the port of S. Iohn de Vllua, but missing the
port went with the shoare and was cast away. There were
drowned of that ship 75. persons, men, women and children,
and 64. were saved that could swim, and had meanes to saue
themselves: among those that perished in that ship, was a
gentlemen who had bene present the yere before in S. Domingo,
his wife and 4. daughters with the rest of his seruants and household.
We with the other 7. ships cast about into the sea, the
storme during 10. dayes with great might, boisterous winds, fogs
and raine: our ship being old and weake was so tossed, that she
opened at the sterne a fadome vnder water, and the best remedy
we had was to stop it with beds and pilobiers, and for feare of
<!--140.png-->
<span class="pagenum">143</span>
sinking we threw and lightned into the sea all the goods we had
or could come by: but that would not serue. Then we cut our
maine mast, and threw all our Ordinance into the sea sauing one
piece, which early in a morning when wee thought wee should
haue sunke, we shot off, and as pleased God there was one of
the ships of our company neere vnto vs, which we saw not by
meanes of the great fogge, which hearing the sound of the piece,
and vnderstanding some of the company to be in great extremitie,
began to make toward vs, and when they came within hearing of
vs, we desired them for the loue of God to helpe to saue vs, for
that we were all like to perish. They willed vs to hoise our
foresaile as much as we could and make towards them, for they
would do their best to saue vs, and so we did. And we had no
sooner hoised our foresaile, but there came a gale of winde and
a piece of a sea, strooke in the foresaile, and caried saile and
maste all ouerboord, so that then we thought there was no hope
of life. And then we began to imbrace one another, euery man
his friend, euery wife her husband, and the children their fathers
and mothers, committing our soules to Almighty God, thinking
neuer to escape aliue: yet it pleased God in the time of most
need when all hope was past, to aide vs with his helping hand,
and caused the winde a little to cease, so that within two houres
after, the other ship was able to come aboord vs, and tooke into
her with her boat man, woman and child, naked without hose or
shoe vpon many of our feete. I do remember that the last person
that came out of the ship into the boat was a woman blacke Moore,
who leaping out of the ship into the boat with a yong sucking
childe in her armes, lept too short and fell into the sea, and was
a good while vnder the water before the boat could come to
rescue her, and with the spreading of her clothes rose aboue water
againe, and was caught by the coat and pulled into the boate hauing
still her child vnder her arme, both of them halfe drowned, and
yet her natural loue towards her child would not let her let the
childe goe. And when she came aboord the boate she helde her
childe so fast vnder her arm still, that two men were scant able
to get it out. So we departed out of our ship and left it in the
sea: it was worth foure hundreth thousand ducats, ship and
goods when we left it. And within three dayes after we arriued
at our port of S. Iohn de Vllua in New Spaine. I do remember
that in the great and boysterous storme of this foule weather,
in the night, there came vpon the toppe of our maine yarde and
<!--141.png-->
<span class="pagenum">144</span>
maine maste, a certaine little light, much like vnto the light of a
little candle, which the Spaniards called the Cuerpo santo, and
saide it was S. Elmo, whom they take to bee the aduocate of
Sailers. At the which sight the Spaniards fell downe vpon their
knees and worshipped it, praying God and S. Elmo to cease the
torment, and saue them from the perill that they were in with
promising him that on their comming on land, they would
repaire vnto his Chappell, and their cause Masses to be saide,
and other ceremonies to be done. The friers cast reliques into
the sea, to cause the sea to be still, and likewise said Gospels,
with other crossings and ceremonies vpon the sea to make
the storme to cease: which (as they said) did much good to
weaken the furie of the storme. But I could not perceiue it,
nor gaue no credite to it, till it pleased God to send vs the
remedie and deliuered vs from the rage of the same, His
Name be praised therefore. This light continued aboord our
ship about three hours, flying from maste to maste, and from
top to top: and sometime it would be in two or three places
at once. I informed my selfe of learned men afterward what
that light should be, and they said, that it was but a congelation
of the winde and vapours of the Sea congealed with
the extremitie of the weather, which flying in the winde, many
times doeth chance to hit on the masts and shrowds of the
ships that are at sea in foule weather. And in trueth I do
take it to be so: for that I haue seene the like in other ships
at sea, and in sundry ships at once. By this men may see
how the Papists are giuen to beleeue and worship such vaine
things and toyes, as God, to whom all honour doth appertaine
and in their neede and necessities do let to call vpon the
liuing God, who is the giuer of all good things.</p>

<span class="sidenote">His arriuall at Vera Cruz.</span>
The 16. of April in Anno 1556. we arrived at the port of
S. Iohn de Vllua in new Spaine, very naked and distressed,
of apparell, and all other things, by meanes of the losse of
our foresaid ship and goods, and from thence we
went to the new Towne called Vera Cruz, fiue leagues
from the said port of S. Iohn de Vllua, marching still
by the sea side, where wee found lying vpon the sands great
quantitie of mightie great trees with roots and all, some of
them of foure, fiue, and sixe cart load by our estimation,
which, as the people told vs, were in the great stormy weather,
which we endured at sea,
<span class="sidenote">Florida 300. leagues from San Iuan de
Vllua.</span>
rooted out of the ground in Terra
<!--142.png-->
<span class="pagenum">145</span>
Florida, which is three hundredth leagues ouer by
Sea, and brought thither. So we came to the saide
Towne of Vera cruz, where wee remained a moneth:
and there the said Iohn Field chanced to meete with
an olde friend of his acquaintance in Spaine, called Gon&ccedil;alo
Ruiz de Cordoua, a very rich man of the saide Towne of
Vera cruz: who hearing of his comming thither with his wife
and family, and of his misfortune by Sea, came vnto him and
receiued him and all his household into his house, and kept
vs there a whole moneth, making vs very good cheere, and
giuing vs good entertainment, and also gaue vs that were in
all eight persons, of the said Iohn Fields house, double apparell
new out of the shop of very good cloth, coates, cloakes, hose,
shirts, smocks, gownes for the women, hose, shoes, and al
other necessary apparel, and for our way vp to the Citie of
Mexico, horses, moiles, and men, and money in our purses
for the expenses by the way, which by our accompt
might amount vnto the summe of 400. Crownes. And
after wee were entred two dayes iourney into the Countrey, I the
saide Robert Tomson fell so sicke of an ague, that the next day
I was not able to sit on my horse, but was faine to be caried
vpon Indians backes, from thence to Mexico. And when wee
came within halfe a dayes iourney of the Citie of Mexico, the
saide Iohn Field also fell sicke, and within three dayes after we
arriued at the said Citie, hee died: And presently sickened one
of his children, and two more of his houshold people, and within
eight days died. So that within tenne dayes after we arriued at
the Citie of Mexico, of eight persons that were of vs of the saide
company, there remained but foure aliue, and I the said Tomson
was at the point of death of the sicknes that I got vpon the way,
which continued with mee the space of sixe moneths. At the
end of which time it pleased Almightie God to restore me my
health againe, although weake and greatly disabled. And being
some thing strong, I procured to seeke meanes to liue, and to
seeke a way how to profite my selfe in the Countrey, seeing it
had pleased God to sende vs thither in safetie. Then by friendship
of one Thomas Blake a Scottishman borne, who had dwelt
and had bene married in the said Citie aboue twentie yeeres
before I came to the saide Citie, I was preferred to the seruice of
a gentleman a Spaniard dwelling there, a man of great wealth,
and one of the first conquerours of the said Citie, whose name
<!--143.png-->
<span class="pagenum">146</span>
was Gon&ccedil;alo Cerezo, with whom I dwelt twelue moneths and a
halfe. At the ende of which I was maliciously accused by the
Holy house for matters of Religion, and so apprehended and
caried to prison, where I lay close prisoner seuen moneths,
without speaking to any creature, but to the Iailer that kept the
said prison, when he brought me my meat and drinke. In the
meane time was brought into the saide prison one Augustin
Boacio an Italian of Genoua also for matters of Religion, who
was taken at Sacatecas 80. leagues to the Northwest of the Citie
of Mexico: At the ende of the said seuen moneths, we were both
caried to the high Church of Mexico, to doe open penance upon
an high scaffold, made before the high Alter, vpon a Sunday, in
presence of a very great number of people, who were at the least
fiue or sixe thousand. For there were that came one hundreth
mile off, to see the said Auto (as they call it) for that there were
neuer none before, that had done the like in the said Countrey,
nor could not tell what Lutheranes were, nor what it meant: for
they neuer heard of any such thing before. We were brought
into the Church, euery one with a S. Benito vpon his backe,
which is halfe a yard of yellow cloth, with a hole to put in a
mans head in the middest, and cast ouer a mans head: both
flaps cast one before, and another behinde, and in the middest
of euery flap, a S. Andrewes crosse, made of red cloth, sowed on
vpon the same, and that is called S. Benito. The common
people before they sawe the penitents come into the Church,
were giuen to vnderstand that wee were heretiques, infidels, and
people that did despise God, and his workes, and that wee had
bene more like deuils than men, and thought wee had had the
fauour of some monsters, or heathen people. And when they
saw vs come into the Church in our players coates, the women
and children beganne to cry out, and made such a noise, that it
was strange to see and heare, saying, that they neuer sawe
goodlier men in all their liues, and that it was not possible that
there could be in vs so much euill as was reported of vs, and that
we were more like Angels among men, then such persons of such
euill Religion as by the Priestes and friers wee were reported to
be, and that it was great pitie that wee should bee so vsed for so
small an offence. So that being brought into the said high
Church, and set vpon the scaffold which was made before the
high Alter, in the presence of all the people, vntil high Masse was
done, and the sermon made by a frier, concerning our matter,
<!--144.png-->
<span class="pagenum">147</span>
they did put vs in all the disgrace they could, to cause the
people not to take so much compassion vpon vs, for that wee were
heretiques, and people that were seduced of the deuill, and had
forsaken the faith of the Catholique Church of Rome, with diuers
other reprochfull wordes, which were too long to recite in this
place. High Masse and Sermon being done, our offences, as they
called them, were recited, euery man what he had said and
done, and presently was the sentence pronounced against vs.
That was that the said Augustine Boacio was condemned to wear
his S. Benito all the dayes of his life, and put into perpetuall
prison, where hee should fulfill the same, and all his goods
confiscated and lost. And I the saide Tomson to weare the
S. Benito for three yeeres, and then to be set at libertie. And
for the accomplishing of this sentence or condemnation, we
must be presently sent downe from Mexico, to Vera Cruz,
and from thence to S. Iohn de Vllua, and there to be shipped
for Spaine, which was 65. leagues by land, with strait commandement,
that vpon paine of 1000. duckets, the Masters
euery one should looke straitly vnto vs, and carry vs to Spaine,
and deliver vs vnto the Inquisitors of the Holy house of Siuill,
that they should put vs in the places, where we should fulfill
our penances, that the Archbishop of Mexico had enioyned
vnto us, by his sentence there giuen. For performance of the
which, we were sent downe from Mexico, to the Sea side,
which was 65. leagues, with fetters upon our feete, and there
deliuered to the Masters of the ships, to be carried for Spaine,
as before is said. And it was so, that the Italian, fearing
that if he had presented himselfe in Spaine before the Inquisitors,
that they would haue burned him, to preuent that danger
when wee were comming homeward, and were arriued at the
yland of Ter&ccedil;era, one of the ysles of the A&ccedil;ores, the first night
that we came into the said port to an ancker, about midnight he
found the meanes to get him naked out of the ship into the sea,
and swam naked a shoare, and so presently got him to the
further side of the yland, where hee found a little Caruel ready
to depart for Portugal, in the which he came to Lisbone, and
passed into France, and so into England, where hee ended his
life in the Citie of London. And I for my part kept still aboord
the ship, and came into Spaine, and was deliuered to the
Inquisitors of the Holy house of Siuill, where they kept me
in close prison, till I had fulfilled the three years of my
<!--145.png-->
<span class="pagenum">148</span>
penance. Which time being expired, I was freely put out of
prison, and set at libertie: and being in the Citie of Siuil a
casher of one Hugh Typton, an English marchant of great
doing, by the space of one yeere, it fortuned that there
came out of the Citie of Mexico, a Spaniard, called Iohn
de la Barrera, that had bene long time in the Indies,
and had got summes of golde and siluer, and with one onely
daughter shipped himselfe for to come for Spaine, and by the
way chanced to die, and giue all that hee had vnto his onely
daughter, whose name was Marie de la Barrera, and being arriued
at the Citie of Siuil, it was my chance to marry with her. The
marriage was worth to mee 2500. pounds in barres of golde and
siluer, besides iewels of great price. This I thought good to
speake of, to shew the goodnes of God to all them that put their
trust in him, that I being brought out of the Indies, in such great
misery and infamy to the world, should be prouided at Gods
hand in one moment, of more then in all my life before I could
attaine vnto by my owne labour.</p>

<p>After we departed from Mexico, our S. Benitoes were set vp
in the high Church of the said Citie, with our names written in
the same, according to there vse and custome, which is and will
be a monument and a remembrance of vs, as long as the Romish
Church doth raigne in that country. The same haue bene seene
since by one Iohn Chilton, and diuers others of our nation,
which were left in that countrey long since, by Sir Iohn Hawkins.
And because it shalbe knowen wherefore it was that I was so
punished by the Clergies hande, as before is mentioned, I will in
briefe words declare the same.</p>

<p>It is so, that being in Mexico at the table, among many principall
people at dinner, they began to inquire of me being an
Englishman, whether it were true, that in England they had
ouerthrowen all their Churches and houses of Religion, and that
all the images of the Saints of heauen that were in them were
throwen downe, broken, and burned, and in some places high
wayes stoned with them, and whether the English nation denied
their obedience to the Pope of Rome, as they had bene certified
out of Spaine by their friends. To whom I made answere, that
it was so, that in deed they had in England put downe all the
Religious houses of friers and monks that were in England, and
the images that were in their Churches and other places were
taken away, and vsed there no more: for that (as they say) the
<!--146.png-->
<span class="pagenum">149</span>
making of them, and putting of them where they were adored,
was cleane contrary to the expresse commandement of Almighty
God, Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, &amp;c.
and that for that cause they thought it not lawfull that they
should stand in the Church, which his the house of adoration.
One that was at the declaring of these words who was my master
Gonsalo Cereso, answered and said, if it were against the commandement
of God to haue images in the Churches, that then
he had spent a great deale of money in vaine, for that two yeres
past he had made in the monastery of Santo Domingo, in the
said citie of Mexico, an image of our Lady of pure siluer and
golde, with pearles and precious stones, which cost him 7000.
and odde pesos, and euery peso is 4.s. 8.d. of our money: which
indeed was true, for that I haue seene it many times my selfe
where it stands. At the table was another gentleman, who presuming
to defend the cause more then any other that was there,
saide, that they knew well ynough that they made but of stockes
and stones, and that to them was no worship giuen, but that
there was a certaine veneration due vnto them after they were
set vp in the Church, and that they were set there to a good
intent: the one, for that they were books for the simple people,
to make them vnderstand the glory of the saints that were in
heauen, and a shape of them to put vs in remembrance to cal
vpon them, to be our intercessors vnto God for vs, for that we
are such miserable sinners, that we are not worthy to appeare
before God, and that vsing deuotion to saints in heauen, they
may obtaine at Gods hands the sooner the thing that we demand
of him. As for example, said he, imagin that a subiect hath offended
his king vpon the earth in any kind of respect, is it for
the party to go boldly to the king in person, and to demand
pardon for his offences? No, saith he, the presumption were two
great, and possibly he might be repulsed, and haue a great rebuke
for his labour. Better it is for such a person to seek some
priuate man neere the king in his Court, and make him acquainted
with his matter, and let him be a mediator to his Maiesty for
him, and for the matter he hath to do with him, and so might he
the better come to his purpose, and obteine the thing which he
doeth demand: euen so saith he, it is with God and his saints
in heauen: for we are wretched sinners, and not worthy to appeare
nor present our selues before the Maiesty of God to demand
of him the thing that we haue need of: therefore thou
<!--147.png-->
<span class="pagenum">150</span>
hast need to be deuout, and have deuotion to the mother of God,
and the saints of heauen, to be intercessors to God for thee, and
so mayest thou the better obtaine of God the thing that thou
dost demand. To this I answered, and said, sir, as touching the
comparison you made of the intercessors to the king, how necessary
they were, I would but aske you this question. Set the case
that this king you speake of, if he be so merciful, as, when he
knoweth that one, or any of his subiects hath offended him, he
send for him to his owne towne, or to his owne house, or palace,
and say unto him, come hither, I know that thou hast offended
many lawes, if thou doest know thereof, and doest repent thee
of the same, with ful intent to offend no more, I wil forgiue thy
trespasse, and remember it no more: said I, if this be done by
the kings owne person, what then hath this man need to go
seeke friendship at any of the kings priuat seruants hands, but
go to the principal, seeing that he is readier to forgive thee, then
thou art to demand forgiuenes at his hands? Euen so is it with
our gracious God, who calleth and crieth out vnto vs throughout
all the world, by the mouth of his Prophets, Apostles, and by his
owne mouth, saying, Come vnto me al ye that labour and are
ouer laden, and I wil refresh you: besides 1000. other offers and
proffers which hee doth make vnto vs in his holy Scriptures.
What then haue we need of the saints helpe that are in heauen,
whereas the Lord himself doth so freely offer himselfe vnto vs?
At which sayings, many of the hearers were astonied, and said,
that by that reason, I would giue to vnderstand, that the inuocation
of Saints was to be disanulled, and by the Lawes of God not
commanded. I answered, that they were not my words but the
words of God himselfe: looke into the Scriptures your selfe, and
you shall so finde it. The talk was perceiued to be preiudiciall
to the Romish doctrine, and therefore it was commanded to be
no more entreated of, and all remained vnthought vpon, had it
not bene for a villanous Portugal that was in the company, who
said, Basta ser Ingles para saber todo esto y mas: who the next
day, without imparting any thing to any body, went to the Bishop
of Mexico, and his Prouisor, and said, that in a place where he
had bene the day before, was an Englishman, who had said, that
there was no need of Saints in the Church, nor of any inuocation
of Saints, vpon whose denomination I was apprehended for the
same words here rehearsed, and none other thing, and thereupon
was vsed, as before is written.</p>

<p><!--148.png--><span class="pagenum">151</span>
<span class="sidenote">Sant Iuan de Vllua.</span>
Now to speake somewhat of the description of the countrey,
you shall vnderstand, that the port of S. Iohn de Vllua
is a very little Island low by the water side, the
broadest or longest part thereof not aboue a bow-shoote
ouer, and standeth within two furlongs of the firme land.
In my time there was but one house, and a little Chappel to say
masse in, in all the Island: the side to the land wards is made
by mans handes, with free-stone and grauel, and is 4. fadome
deepe downe right, wherefore the great ships that come in there
do ride so neere the shoare of the land, that you may come and
goe aland vpon their beake noses. They vse to put great chaines
of yron in at their halsers, and an ancker to the land ward, and
all little ynough to more well their shippes for feare of the
Northerly winds, which come of the coast of Florida, that sometimes
haue caried ships, and houses, and all away to the shoare.
The king was wont to haue 20. great mightie Negroes, who did
serue for nothing else, but onely to repaire the said Island, where
the foule weather doeth hurt it. The Countrey all thereabout
is very plaine ground, and a mile from the sea side a great wildernes,
with great quantitie of red Deere in the same, so that
when the mariners of the ships are disposed, they go vp into the
wildernes, and do kil of the same, and bring them aboard to eate,
for their recreation.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The way and distance from San Iuan de Vllua to Vera
Cruz, is five leagues.</span>
From this port to the next towne, which is called
Vera Cruz, are 5. leagues almost by the Sea side, till
you come within one league of the place, and then
you turne vp towards the land, into a wood, till you
come to a litle riuer hard by the said townes side,
which sometimes of the yere is dry without water.
The towne of Vera Cruz in my time, had not past
300. housholds, and serued out but for the folke of the ships, to
buy and bring there goods aland, and deliuer it to their owners,
as also the owners and their factors to receiue there goods of the
Masters of the ships. This town standeth also in a very plaine
on the one side the riuer, and the other side is enuironed with
much sande blowen from the sea side with the tempest of
weather, many times comming vpon that coast. This town also
is subiect to great sicknes, and in my time many of the Mariners
and officers of the ships did die with those diseases, there accustomed,
and especially those that were not vsed to the countrey,
nor knew the danger thereof, but would commonly go in the
<!--149.png-->
<span class="pagenum">152</span>
Sunne in the heat of the day, and did eat fruit of the countrey
with much disorder, and especially gaue themselues to womens
company at their first comming: whereupon they were cast into
a burning ague, of the which few escaped.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Venta de Rinconado.</span>
Halfe a dayes iourney from Vera Cruz, towards
Mexico, is a lodging of fiue or sixe houses, called
the Rinconado, which is a place, where is a great
pinacle made of lime and stone, fast by a riuer side, where
the Indians were wont to doe their sacrifices vnto their gods,
and it is plaine and low ground betwixt that and Vera Cruz,
and also subiect to sicknes: but afterward halfe a dayes
iourney that you do begin to enter into the high land, you
shall find as faire, good, and sweet countrey, as any in the
world, and the farther you go, the goodlier and sweeter
the countrey is, till you come to Pueblo de los Angeles, which
may be some 43 leagues from Vera Cruz, which was in my
time a towne of 600. housholds, or thereabout, standing in a
goodly soile. Betweene Vera Cruz and that you shall come
through many townes of the Indians, and villages, and many
goodly fields of medow grounds, Riuers of fresh waters, forrests,
and great woods, very pleasant to behold. From Pueblo de los
Angeles, to Mexico, is 20 leagues of very faire way and countrey,
as before is declared. Mexico was a Citie in my time, of not
aboue 1500. housholds of Spaniards inhabiting there, but of
Indian people in the suburbs of the said city, dwelt aboue
300000. as it was thought, and many more. This City of
Mexico is 65 leagues from the North sea, and 75 leagues from
the South sea, so that it standeth in the midst of the maine
land, betwixt the one sea and the other. It is situated in the
middest of a lake of standing water, and enuironed round
about with the same, sauing in many places, going out of
the Citie, are many broad wayes through the said lake or
water. This lake and Citie is enuironed also with great
mountaines round about, which are in compasse aboue thirtie
leagues, and the said Citie, and lake of standing water, doeth
stand in a great plaine in the middest of it. This lake of
standing water doeth proceed from the shedding of the raine,
that falleth upon the saide mountaines, and so gather themselues
together in this place.</p>

<p>All the whole proportion of this Citie doeth stand in a very
plaine ground, and in the middest of the said Citie is a square
<!--150.png-->
<span class="pagenum">153</span>
place of a good bow-shoote ouer from side to side: and in the
middest of the said place is the high Church, very faire and well
builded all through, at that time not halfe finished, and round
about the said place, are many faire houses built: on the one
side, are the houses where Mutezuma the great king of Mexico
that was, dwelt, and now there lye alwayes the viceroyes that the
king of Spaine sendeth thither euery three yeeres. And in my
time there was for viceroy a gentleman of Castil, called Don Luis
de Velasco. And on the other side of the saide place, ouer
against the same, is the Bishops house, very faire built, and many
other houses of goodly building. And hard by the same, are
also other very faire houses, built by the Marques de Valle,
otherwise called Hernando Cortes, who was hee that first conquered
the saide Citie and Countrey, who after the said conquest
which hee made with great labour and trauaile of his person, and
danger of his life, and being growen great in the Countrey, the
King of Spaine sent for him, saying that he had some
particular matters to impart vnto him.
<span class="sidenote">This is to be vnderstood of his second comming
into Spaine.</span>
And when he
came home, he could not bee suffered to returne
backe againe, as the King before had promised him.
With the which, for sorrow that he tooke, he died;
and this he had for the reward of his good seruice.</p>

<p>The said Citie of Mexico hath the streetes made very broad,
and right, that a man being in the high place, at the one ende of
the street, may see at the least a good mile forward, and in all
the one part of the streets of the North part of their Citie, there
runneth a pretie lake of very cleare water, that euery man may
put into his house as much as he will, without the cost of any
thing, but of letting in. Also there is a great caue or ditch of
water that commeth through the Citie, euen vnto the high place,
where come euery morning at the break of the day twentie or
thirtie Canoas, or troughes of the Indians, which bring in them
all manner of prouision for the citie, which is made, and groweth
in the Countrey, which is a very good commoditie for the inhabitants
of that place. And as for victuals in the said Citie, of
beefe, mutton, and hennes, capons, quailes, Guiny-cockes, and
such like, all are very good cheape: To say, the whole quarter of
an oxe, as much as a slaue can carry away from the Butchers, for
fiue Tomynes, that is, fiue Royals of plate, which is iust two
shillings and sixe pence, and a fat sheepe at the Butchers for
three Royals, which is 18. pence and no more. Bread is as good
<!--151.png-->
<span class="pagenum">154</span>
cheape as in Spaine, and all other kinde of fruites, as apples,
peares, pomegranats, and quinces, at a reasonable rate. The
Citie goeth wonderfully forwards in building of Frieries and
Nunneries, and Chappels, and is like in time to come, to be the
most populous Citie in the world, as it may be supposed. The
weather is there always very temperate, the day differeth but one
houre of length all the yere long. The fields and the woods are
alwayes greene. The woods full of popinjayes, and many other
kinde of birdes, that make such an harmonie of singing, and
crying, that any man will reioyce to heare it. In the fields are
such odoriferous smels of flowers and hearbs, that it giueth great
content to the senses. About the Citie of Mexico two, three, or
foure leagues off, are diuers townes of Indians, some of 4000. or
6000. housholds, which doe stand in such a goodly soyle, that if
Christians had the inhabitation thereof, it would be put to a
further benefite. In my time were dwelling and aliue in Mexico,
many ancient men that were of the conquerours at the first
conquest with Hernando Cortes: for then it was about 36. yeeres
agoe, that the said Countrey was conquered.</p>

<p>About Mexico there are diuers Mines of siluer, and also in
other places there about, but the principall Mines that are in
all New Spaine are in Sacatecas, 80. leagues from Mexico, and
the Mines of S. Martin, thirtie leagues, both to the Westward
of Mexico, where is great store of gold and siluer. Also there is
a place called the Misteca, fiftie leagues to the Northwest, which
doth yeeled great store of very good silke, and Cochinilla.
Wine and oyle there is none growing in the Countrey, but
what commeth out of Spaine. Also there are many goodly
fruits in that Countrey, whereof we haue none such, as Plantanos
Guyaues, Lapotes, Tunas, and in the wilderness great store of
blacke cheries, and other wholesome fruites. The Cochinilla is
not a worme, or a flye, as some say it is, but a berrie that groweth
vpon certaine bushes in the wilde field, which is gathered in
time of the yeere, when it is ripe. Also the Indico that doeth
come from thence to die blew, is a certaine hearbe that groweth
in the wilde fieldes, and is gathered at one time of the yeere,
and burnt, and of the ashes thereof, with other confections put
thereunto, the said Indico is made. Balme, Salsa perilla, Cana
fistula, suger, oxe hides, and many other good and seruiceable
things the Countrey doeth yeeld, which are yeerely brought into
Spaine, and there solde and distributed to many nations.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2"><a name="a313" id="a313"></a>A voyage made by M. Roger Bodenham to S. Iohn de
Vllua in the bay of Mexico, in the yeere 1564.</div>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A new trade begun in the city of Fez by Roger
Bodenham.</span>
I Rodger Bodenham hauing a long time liued in the city of
Siuil in Spaine, being there married, and by occasion thereof
vsing trade and traffique to the parts of Barbary, grew at
length to great losse and hinderance by that new
trade begun by me in the city of Fez: whereupon
being returned into Spaine, I began to call my wits
about mee, and to consider with my selfe by what
meanes I might recover and renew my state; and in
conclusion, by the ayde of my friends, I procured a ship
called The Barke Fox perteining to London, of the eight or
nine score tunnes; and with the same I made a voyage to the West
India, hauing obteined good fauour with the Spannish merchants,
by reason of my long abode, and marriage of the countrey. My
voyage was in the company of the Generall Don Pedro Melendes
for Noua Hispania: who being himselfe appointed Generall
for Terra Firma and Peru, made his sonne Generall for
New Spaine, although Pedro Melendes himselfe was the principall
man and director in both fleets. We all departed from
Cadiz together the last day of May in the yere 1564: and I
with my ship being vnder the conduct of the sonne of
Don Pedro aforesayd, arriued with him in Noua Hispania,
where immediately I tooke order for the discharge of my
merchandise at the port of Vera Cruz, otherwise called Villa
Rica, to be transported thence to the city of Mexico, which is
sixty and odde leagues distant from the sayd port of Villa Rica.
In the way are many good townes, as namely, Pueblo de los
Angeles, and another called Tlaxcalan. The city of Mexico hath
three great causeyes to bring men to it, compassed with a lake,
so that it needeth no walles, being so defended by the water.
It is a city plentifull of all necessary things, hauing many faire
houses, churches, and monasteries. I hauing continued in the
countrey the space of nine moneths, returned againe for Spaine
with the Spanish fleet, and deliuered the merchandise and siluer
which I had in the ship into the Contratation house, and there
receiued my fraight, which amounted outwards and homewards
to the value of 13000 ducats and more. I obserued many things
in the time of my abode in Noua Hispania, aswell touching the
commodities of the countrey as the maners of the people both
<!--153.png-->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Spaniards and Indians: but because the Spanish histories are
full of these obseruations, I omit them, and referre the readers to
the same: onely this I say, that the commodity of Cochinalla
groweth in greatest abundance about the towne of Pueblo de los
Angeles, and is not there woorth aboue forty pence the pound.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2"><a name="a322" id="a322"></a>A notable discourse of M. Iohn Chilton, touching the people,
maners, mines, cities, riches, forces, and other memorable
things of New Spaine, and other prouinces in the West
Indies, seene and noted by himselfe in the time of his
trauels, continued in those parts, the space of seuenteene
or eighteene yeeres.</div>

<p>In the yeere of our Lord 1561, in the moneth of Iuly, I Iohn
Chilton went out of this city of London into Spaine, where I
remained for the space of seuen yeres, and from thence I sailed
into Noua Hispania, and so trauelled there, and by the South
sea, vnto Peru, the space of seuenteene or eighteene yeeres: and
after that time expired, I returned into Spaine, and so in the
yere 1586 in the moneth of Iuly, I arriued at the foresayd city of
London: where perusing the notes which I had taken in the
time of my trauell in those yeeres, I haue set downe as followeth.</p>

<p>In the yeere 1568, in the moneth of March, being desirous to
see the world, I embarked my selfe in the bay of Cadiz in
Andaluzia, in a shippe bound for the Isles of the Canaries, where
she tooke in her lading, and set forth from thence for the voyage,
in the moneth of Iune, the same yere. Within a moneth after,
we fell with the Isle of S. Domingo, and from thence directly to
Noua Hispania, and came into the port of S. Iohn de Vllua,
which is a little Island standing in the sea, about two miles from
the land, where the king mainteineth about 50 souldiers, and
captaines, that keepe the forts, and about 150 negroes, who all
the yeere long are occupied in carying of stones for building, and
other vses, and to helpe to make fast the ships that come in
there, with their cables. There are built two bulwarkes at ech
ende of a wall, that standeth likewise in the sayde island, where
the shippes vse to ride, made fast to the sayd wall with their
cables, so neere, that a man may leape ashore. From this port
I iourneyd by land to a towne called Vera Cruz, standing by a
riuers side, where all the factours of the Spanish merchants dwell,
which receiue the goods of such ships as come thither, and also
<!--154.png-->
<span class="pagenum">157</span>
lade the same with such treasure and merchandize as they returne
backe into Spaine. They are in number about foure hundred,
who onely remaine there during the time that the Spanish fleet
dischargeth, and is loden againe, which is from the end of August
to the beginning of April following. And then for the vnwholesomnesse
of the place they depart thence sixteene leagues
further vp within the countrey, to a towne called Xalapa, a very
healthfull soile. There is neuer any woman deliuered of childe
in this port of Vera Cruz: for so soone as they perceiue themselues
conceiued with child, they get them into the countrey, to
auoid the perill of the infected aire, although they vse euery
morning to driue thorow the towne aboue two thousand head of
cattell, to take away the ill vapours of the earth. From Xalapa
seuen leagues I came to another place, named Perota, wherein
are certaine houses builded of straw, called by the name of
ventas, the inhabitants whereof are Spaniards, who accustome to
harbour such trauellers as are occasioned to iourney that way vp
into the land. It standeth in a great wood of Pine and Cedar
trees, the soile being very colde, by reason of store of snow which
lieth on the mountaines there all the yere long. There are in
that place an infinite number of deere, of bignesse like vnto great
mules, hauing also hornes of great length. From Perota nine
leagues, I came to the Fuentes of Ozumba, which fuentes are
springs of water issuing out of certeine rocks into the midst of
the high wayes, where likewise are certaine ranges, and houses,
for the vses before mentioned.
<span class="sidenote">Pueblo de los Angeles eight leagues.</span>
Eight leagues off
from this place I came to the city of the Angels, so
called by that name of the Spanyards, which inhabit
there to the number of a thousand, besides a great
number of Indians. This city standeth in very plaine fields,
hauing neere adioyning to it many sumptuous cities, as namely
the city of Tlaxcalla, a city of two hundred thousand Indians,
tributaries to the king, although he exacteth no other tribute of
them then a handfull of wheat a piece, which amounteth to
thirteene thousand hanneges yeerely as hath appeared by the
kings books of account. And the reason why he contenteth
himselfe with this tribute, onely for them, is, because they were
the occasion that he tooke the city of Mexico, with whom the
Tlaxcallians had warre at the same time when the Spanyards
came into the countrey. The gouernour of this city is a
Spanyard, called among them the Alcade mayor, who
<!--155.png-->
<span class="pagenum">158</span>
administreth chiefest causes of iustice both vnto the Christians and
Indians, referring smaller and lighter vices, as drunkennesse and
such like to the iudgement and discretion of such of the Indians
as are chosen euery yeere to rule amongst them, called by the
name of Alcades. These Indians from fourteene yeeres olde
vpwards, pay vnto the king for their yerely tribute one ounce of
siluer, and an hannege of maiz, which is valued among them
commonly at twelue reals of plate. The widowes among them
pay halfe of this. The Indians both of this city, and of the rest,
lying about Mexico, goe clothed with mantles of linnen cloth
made of cotton wooll, painted thorowout with works of diuers
and fine colours.
<span class="sidenote">Tlaxcalla foure leagues northward from los
Angeles.</span>
It is distant from the city of the
Angels foure leagues to the Northward, and fourteene
from Mexico. There is another city a league from it,
called Chetula, consisting of more then sixty thousand
Indians, tributaries, and there dwell not aboue twelue
Spanyards there.
<span class="sidenote">Vulcan is a hill that continually burneth with
fire.</span>
From it, about two leagues, there is another,
called Acassingo, of aboue fifty thousand Indians, and about
eight or twelue Spanyards, which standeth at the foot
of the Vulcan of Mexico, on the East side. There
are besides these, three other great cities, the one
named Tapiaca, a very famous city, Waxazingo, and
Tichamachalcho: all these in times past belonged to
the kingdome of Tlaxcalla: and from these cities they bring
most of their Cochinilla into Spaine.
<span class="sidenote">Pueblo de los Angeles 20. leagues from
Mexico.</span>
The distance from the
city of the Angels, to the city of Mexico is twenty
leagues. The city of Mexico is the city of greatest
fame in all the Indies, hauing goodly and costly houses
in it, builded all of lime and stone, and seuen streets
in length, and seuen in breadth, with riuers running thorow euery
second street, by which they bring their prouision in canoas.
It is situated at the foot of certaine hilles, which conteine in
compasse by estimation aboue twenty leagues, compassing the
sayd city on the one side, and a lake which is fourteene leagues
about on the other side. Vpon which lake there are built
many notable and sumptuous cities, as the city of Tescuco,
where the Spanyards built sixe frigats, at that time when they
conquered Mexico, and where also Fernando Cortes made his
abode fiue or six moneths in curing of the sicknesse of his
people, which they had taken at their comming into the countrey.
There dwell in this city about sixty thousand Indians, which pay
<!--156.png-->
<span class="pagenum">159</span>
tribute to the king. In this city the sayd Fernando built the
finest church that euer was built in the Indies, the name whereof
is S. Peters.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The voyage from Mexico to Nueua Biscaia.</span>
After I had continued two yeeres in this city, being desirous
to see further the countreys, I imployed that which I
had, and tooke my voyage towards the prouinces of
California, in the which was discouered a certeine
countrey by a Biscaine, whose name was Diego de
Guiara, and called it after the name of his countrey, New Biscay,
where I solde my merchandise for exchange of siluer, for there
were there certaine rich mines discouered by the aforesayd
Biskaine.
<span class="sidenote">The Siluer mines of Tamascaltepec.</span>
Going from Mexico I directed my voyage
somewhat toward the Southwest, to certaine mines,
called Tamascaltepec, and so trauelled forward the
space of twenty dayes thorow desert places vnhabited,
till I came to the valley of S. Bartholomew, which ioyneth to the
prouince of New Biscay. In all these places, the Indians for the
most part go naked, and are wilde people. Their common
armour is bowes and arrowes: they vse to eate vp such Christians
as they come by.
<span class="sidenote">The hauen where the ships of China and the
Philippinas arriue.</span>
From hence departing, I came to
another prouince named Xalisco, and from thence to the port
of Nauidad, which is 120 leagues from Mexico, in
which port arriue alwayes in the moneth of April, all
the ships that come out of the South sea from China,
and the Philippinas, and there they lay their merchandise
ashore. The most part whereof is mantles,
made of Cotton wooll, Waxe, and fine platters gilded, made of
earth, and much golde.</p>

<p>The next Summer following, being in the yeere 1570 (which
was the first yeere that the Popes Buls were brought into the
Indies) I vndertooke another voyage towards the prouince of
Sonsonate, which is in the kingdome of Guatimala, whither I
caried diuers marchandize of Spaine, all by land on mules backs.
The way thitherward from Mexico is to the city of the Angels,
and from thence to another city of Christians 80 leagues off,
called Guaxaca, in which there dwelt about 50 Spanyards, and
many Indians. All the Indians of this prouince pay their tribute
in mantles, of Cotton wooll, and Cochinilla, whereof there
groweth abundance thorowout this countrey. Neere to this
place there lieth a port in the South sea, called Aguatulco, in
the which there dwell not aboue three or foure Spanyards, with
<!--157.png-->
<span class="pagenum">160</span>
certaine Negroes, which the king mainteineth there: in which
place Sir Francis Drake arriued in the yeere 1579, in the moneth
of April, where I lost with his being there aboue a thousand
duckets, which he tooke away with much other goods of other
merchants of Mexico from one Francisco Gomes Rangifa, factour
there for all the Spanish merchants that then traded in the South
sea: for from this Port they vse to imbarke all their goods that
goe for Peru, and to the kingdome of Honduras. From Guaxaca
I came to a towne named Nixapa, which standeth vpon certaine
very high hilles in the prouince of Sapotecas, wherein inhabit
about the number of twenty Spanyards, by the King of Spaines
commandement, to keepe that country in peace: for the Indians
are very rebellious: and for this purpose hee bestowed on them
the townes and cities that be within that prouince. From hence
I went to a city called Tecoantepec, which is the farthest towne
to the Eastward in all Noua Hispania, which some time did
belong to the Marques de Valle, and because it is a very fit
port, standing in the South sea, the king of Spaine, vpon a
rebellion made by the sayd Marques against him, tooke it from
him, and doth now possesse it as his owne. Heere in the yeere
1572 I saw a piece of ordinance of brasse, called a Demy
culuerin, which came out of a ship called the Iesus of Lubeck,
which captaine Hawkins left in S. Iohn de Vllua, being in fight
with the Spanyards in the yeere 1568; which piece they afterwards
carried 100 leagues by land ouer mighty mountaines to
the sayd city, to be embarked there for the Philippinas. Leauing
Tecoantepec, I went still along by the South sea about 150
leagues in the desolate prouince of Soconusco, in which prouince
there groweth cacao, which the Christians cary from thence into
Noua Hispania, for that it will not grow in any colde countrey.
The Indians of this countrey pay the king their tribute in cacao,
giuing him four hundred cargas, and euery carga is 24000
almonds, which carga is worth in Mexico thirty pieces of reals
of plate. They are men of great riches, and withall very proud:
and in all this prouince thorowout, there dwell not twenty Christians.
I trauelled thorow another prouince called Suchetepec;
and thence to the prouince of Guasacapan: in both which prouinces
are very few people, the biggest towne therein hauing not
aboue two hundred Indians. The chiefest merchandise there, is
cacao. Hence I went to the city of Guatimala, which is the
chiefe city of all this kingdome: in this city doe inhabit about
<!--158.png-->
<span class="pagenum">161</span>
80 Spanyards: and here the king hath his gouernours, and
councell, to whom all the people of the kingdome repaire for
iustice. This city standeth from the coast of the South sea 14
leagues within the land, and is very rich, by reason of the golde
that they fetch out of the coast of Veragua. From this city to
the Eastward 60 leagues lieth the prouince Sonsonate, where I
solde the merchandize I caried out of Noua Hispania. The
chiefest city of this prouince is called S. Saluador, which lieth 7
leagues from the coast of the South sea, and hath a port lying by
the sea coast, called Acaxutla, where the ships arriue with the
merchandize they bring from Noua Hispania; and from thence
lade backe againe the cacao: there dwell here to the number of
threescore Spanyards.
<span class="sidenote">Nicoia a port where ye ships which goe to the
Philippinas are builded.</span>
From Sonsonate I trauelled
to Nicoia, which is in the kingdome of Nicaragua, in
which port the king buildeth all the shipping that
trauell out of the Indies to the Malucos.
<span class="sidenote">Puerto de Cauallos a rich place.</span>
I went
forward from thence to Costa rica, where the Indians
both men and women go all naked, and the land lieth betweene
Panama, and the kingdome of Guatimala: and for that the Indians
there liue as warriers, I durst not passe by land, so that here
in a towne called S. Saluador I bestowed that which I caried in
annile (which is a kinde of thing to die blew withall)
which I caried with me to the port of Cauallos, lying
in the kingdome of Honduras, which port is a mighty
huge gulfe, and at the comming in on the one side of it there
lieth a towne of little force without ordinance or any other
strength, hauing in it houses of straw: at which towne the
Spanyards vse yeerely in the moneth of August to vnlade foure
ships which come out of Spaine laden with rich merchandize,
and receiue in heere againe their lading of a kinde of merchandise
called Annile and Cochinilla (although it be not of such value as
that of Noua Hispania) and siluer of the mines of Tomaangua,
and golde of Nicaragua, and hides, and Salsa perilla, the best in
all the Indies: all which merchandize, they returne, and depart
from thence alwayes in the moneth of April following, taking
their course by the Island of Iamaica, in which Island there
dwell on the West side of it certeine Spanyards of no great
number.
<span class="sidenote">The description of Hauana at large.</span>
From this place they go to the cape of
S. Anthony, which is the vttermost part of the Westward
of the Island of Cuba, and from thence to
Hauana lying hard by, which is the chiefest port
<!--159.png-->
<span class="pagenum">162</span>
that the king of Spaine hath in all the countreys of the Indies, and
of greatest importance: for all the ships, both from Peru, Honduras,
Porto rico, S. Domingo, Iamaica, and all other places in
his Indies, arriue there in their returne to Spaine, for that in this
port they take in victuals and water, and the most part of their
lading: here they meet from all the foresayd places alwayes in
the beginning of May by the kings commandement: at the
entrance of this port it is so narrow, that there can scarse come
in two ships together, although it be aboue sixe fadome deepe in
the narrowest place of it. In the North side of the comming in
there standeth a tower, in which there watcheth euery day a man
to descrie the sailes of ships which hee can see on the sea; and
as many as he discouereth, so many banners he setteth vpon the
tower, that the people of the towne (which standeth within the
port about a mile from the tower) may vnderstand thereof.
Vnder this tower there lieth a sandy shore, where men may easily
go aland: and by the tower there runneth a hill along by the
waters side, which easily with small store of ordinance subdueth
the towne and port. The port within is so large that there may
easily ride a thousand saile of ships without anker or cable, for
no wind is able to hurt them.
<span class="sidenote">The smol force of Hauana.</span>
There inhabit within
the towne of Hauana about three hundred Spanyards,
and about threescore souldiers, which the king mainteineth
there for the keeping of a certeine castle which hee hath
of late erected, which hath planted in it about twelue pieces of
small ordinance, and is compassed round with a small ditch,
wherethorow at their pleasure they may let in the sea. About
two leagues from Hauana their lieth another towne called
Wanabacoa, in which there is dwelling about an hundred Indians,
and from this place 60 leagues there lieth another towne named
Bahama, situate on the North side of the Island. The chiefest
city of this Island of Cuba (which is aboue 600 leagues in
length) is also called Sant Iago de Cuba, where dwelleth a
bishop and about two hundred Spanyards; which towne standeth
on the South side of the Island about 100 leagues from Hauana.
<span class="sidenote">The commodities of Cuba.</span>
All the trade of this Island is cattell, which they kill
onely for the hides that are brought thence into
Spaine: for which end the Spanyards mainteine
there many negroes to kil their cattell, and foster a great number of
hogs, which being killed, and cut into smal pieces, they dry in the
Sun, and so make it prouision for the ships which come for Spaine.</p>

<p><!--160.png--><span class="pagenum">163</span></p>

<p>Hauing remained in this Island two moneths, I tooke
shipping in a frigat, and went ouer to Nombre de Dios, and
from thence by land to Panama, which standeth vpon the South
sea. From Nombre de Dios to Panama is 17 leagues distance:
from which towne there runneth a riuer which is called
the riuer of Chagre, which runneth within 5 leagues of Panama,
to a place called Cruzes, thorow which riuer they cary their goods,
and disimbarke them at the sayd Cruzes, and from thence they
are conueyed on mules backs to Panama by land: where they
againe imbarke them in certeine small shippes in the South sea
for all the coast of Peru. In one of these ships I went to
Potossie, and from thence by land to Cusco, and from thence to
Paita.</p>

<p>Here I remained the space of seuen moneths, and then returned
into the kingdome of Guatimala, and arriued in the
prouince of Nicoia, and Nicaragua. From Nicaragua I trauelled
by land to a prouince called Nicamula (which lieth toward the
North sea in certaine high mountaines) for that I could not
passe thorow the kingdome of Guatimala at that time for waters,
wherewith all the Low countreys of the prouince of Soconusco,
lying by the South sea, are drowned with the raine that falleth
aboue the mountaines, enduring always from April to September:
which reason for that they call their Winter. From this
prouince I came into another called De Vera Paz, in which the
chiefest city is also called after that name, where there dwelleth
a bishop and about forty Spanyards. Among the mountaines of
this countrey toward the North sea, there is a prouince called
La Candona, where are Indian men of war which the king can
not subdue, for that they haue townes and forts in a great lake of
water aboue the sayd mountaines: the most part of them goe
naked, and some weare mantles of cotton wooll.
<span class="sidenote">Chiapa 300 leagues from Mexico.</span>
Distant from this about 80 leagues, I came into
another prouince called the prouince of Chiapa,
wherein the chiefest city is called Sacallan, where there dwelleth
a bishop and about an hundred Spanyards. In this countrey
there is great store of Cotten wooll, whereof the Indians make
fine linnen cloth, which the Christians buy and carry into Noua
Hispania. The people of this prouince pay their tribute to the
king all in Cotton wooll and Feathers. Fourteene leagues from
this city there is another called Chiapa, where are the finest
gennets in all the Indies, which are carried hence to Mexico,
<!--161.png-->
<span class="pagenum">164</span>
300 leagues from it.
<span class="sidenote">Ecatepec an hill nine leagues high.</span>
From this city I trauelled still thorow hilles
and mountaines, till I came to the end of this prouince,
to a hill called Ecatepec, which in English
signifieth The hill of winde: for that they say, it is
the highest hill that euer was discouered: for from
the top of it may be discovered both the North and the South
seas; and it is in height supposed to be nine leagues. They
which trauell ouer it, lie alwayes at the foot of it ouer night,
and begin their iourney about midnight, to trauell to the top of it
before the Sunne rise the next day, because the winde bloweth
with such force afterwards, that it is impossible for any man to
goe vp: from the foot of this hill to Tecoantepec, the first towne of
Noua Hispania, are about fifteene leagues. And so from hence I
iourned to Mexico.</p>

<p>By and by after I came to Mexico (which was in the yere
1572) in the company of another Spanyard, which was my companion
in this iourney, we went together toward the prouince of
Panuco, which lieth vpon the coast of the North sea, and within
three dayes iourney we entred a city called Mestitlan, where there
dwelt twelue Spanyards: the Indian inhabitants there were about
thirty thousand. This city standeth vpon certaine hie mountaines,
which are very thicke planted with townes very holesome
and fruitfull, hauing plentifull fountaines of water running thorow
them. The high wayes of these hilles are all set with fruits, and
trees of diuers kindes, and most pleasant. In euery towne as we
passed thorow, the Indians presented vs with victuals. Within
twenty leagues of this place there is another city called Clanchinoltepec,
belonging to a gentleman, where there inhabit about
fourty thousand Indians; and there are among them eight or
nine friers of the order of Saint Augustine, who haue there a
Monastery. Within three dayes after we departed from this
place, and came to a city called Guaxutla, where there is another
Monastery of friers of the same Order: there dwell in this towne
about twelue Spanyards. From this place forwards beginneth a
prouince called Guastecan, which is all plaine grounds without
any hilles. The first towne we came vnto is called Tancuylabo,
in which there dwell many Indians, high of stature, hauing all
their bodies painted with blew, and weare their haire long downe
to their knees, tied as women vse to do with their haire-laces.
When they goe out of their doores, they cary with them their
bowes and arrowes, being very great archers, going for the most

part naked.
<span class="sidenote">Salt a principal merchandize.</span>
In those countreys they take neither golde nor
siluer for exchange of any thing, but only Salt, which
they greatly esteeme, and vse it for a principall medicine
for certaine wormes which breed in their lips and
in their gummes. After nine dayes trauell from this place, we
came to a towne called Tampice, which is a port towne vpon the
sea, wherein there dwell, I thinke, forty Christians, of which
number whilest wee abode there, the Indians killed foureteene,
as they were gathering of Salt, which is all the trade that they
haue in this place: it standeth vpon the entrie of the riuer of
Panuco, which is a mighty great riuer; and were it not for a sand
that lieth at the mouth of it, ships of fiue hundred tonne might
goe vp into it aboue three score leagues. From hence we went
to Panuco, foureteen leagues from Tampice, which in times past
had bene a goodly city, where the king of Spaine had his gouernour:
but by reason that the Indians there destroyed the
Christians, it lieth in a maner waste, conteining in it not aboue
tenne Christians with a priest. In this towne I fell sicke, where
I lay one and forty dayes, hauing no other sustenance then fruit
and water, which water I sent for aboue sixe leagues off within
the countrey. Here I remained till my companion came to me,
which had departed from me another way, reteining in my company
onely a slaue, which I brought with me from Mexico. And
the last day in Easter weeke my companion came to me, finding
me in a very weake state, by reason of the vnholesomenesse of
the place. Notwithstanding my weakenesse, I being set on an
horse, and an Indian behinde mee to holde mee, we went forward
on our voyage all that day till night. The next day in the morning
we passed ouer the riuer in a canoa; and being on the other
side, I went my selfe before alone: and by reason there met
many wayes traled by the wilde beasts, I lost my way, and so
trauelled thorow a great wood about two leagues: and at length
fell into the hands of certaine wilde Indians, which were there in
certaine cottages made of straw; who seeing me, came out to the
number of twenty of them, with their bowes and arrowes, and
spake vnto mee in their language, which I vnderstood not: and
so I made signes vnto them to helpe mee from my horse; which
they did by commandement of their lord, which was there with
them: and lighted downe. They caried me vnder one of their
cottages, and layed me vpon a mat on the ground: and perceiuing
that I could not vnderstand them, they brought vnto mee a little
<!--163.png--><span class="pagenum">166</span>
Indian wench of Mexico, of fifteene or sixteene yeeres of age,
whom they commanded to aske me in her language from
whence I came, and for what intent I was come among
them: for (sayth she) doest thou not know Christian,
how that these people will kill and eat thee? To whom I
answered, let them doe with me what they will; heere now I am.
Shee replied, saying, thou mayest thank God thou art leane;
for they feare thou hast the pocks: otherwise they would eate
thee. So I presented to the king a little wine which I had with
me in a bottle; which he esteemed aboue any treasure: for
wine they will sell their wiues and children. Afterwards the
wench asked me what I would haue, and whether I would eat
any thing. I answered that I desired a little water to drinke,
for that the countrey is very hote: and shee brought me a great
Venice glasse, gilded, full of water. And maruelling at the
glasse, I demanded how they came by it. She tolde me that the
Casique brought it from Shallapa, a great towne distant 30 leagues
from this place on the hilles, whereas dwelt certeine Christians,
and certeine friers of the Order of S. Augustine, which this
Casique with his people on a night slew: and burning the friers
monasterie, among other things reserued this glasse: and from
thence also brought me. Hauing now bene conuersant with
them about three or four houres, they bid her aske me if I
would goe my way. I answered her, that I desired nothing els.
So the Casique caused two of his Indians to leade me forward in
my way; going before me with their bowes and arrowes, naked,
the space of three leagues, till they brought me into an high
way: and then making a signe vnto me, they signified that in
short time I should come to a towne where Christians inhabited,
which was called S. Iago de los valles, standing in plaine fields,
walled about with a mud wall: the number of the Christians that
dwelt therein, were not aboue foure or fiue and twenty, vnto
which the king of Spaine giueth Indians and townes, to keepe the
countreys subiect vnto him. Here the Christians haue their
mighty mules, which they cary for all the parts of the Indies, and
into Peru, for that all their merchandize are carried by this
meanes by land. In this towne aforesayd, I found my
company which I had lost before, who made no other account
of me but that I had beene slaine: and the Christians there
likewise maruelled to heare that I came from those kinde of
Indians aliue, which was a thing neuer seene nor heard of
<!--164.png-->
<span class="pagenum">167</span>
before: for they take a great pride in killing a Christian, and to
weare any part of him where he hath any haire growing, hanging
it about their necks, and so are accounted for valiant
men.
<span class="sidenote">Don Henrico Manriques viceroy of Mexico.</span>
In
this towne I remained eighteene dayes, till I recouered my health,
and in the meane space there came one Don Francisco
de Pago, whom the viceroy Don Henrico
Manriques had sent for captaine generall, to open
and discouer a certeine way from the sea side to the
mines of Sacatecas, which were from this place 160 leagues, for
to transport their merchandize by that way, leauing the way by
Mexico, which is seuen or eight weeks trauell. So this captaine
tooke me and my company, with the rest of his souldiers, to the
number of forty, which he had brought with him, and fiue hundred
Indians, which we tooke out of two towns in this prouince
called Tanchipa, and Tamaclipa, all good archers and naked
men, and went thence to the riuer de las Palmas, which is of
great bignesse, parting the kingdome of Noua Hispania and
Florida: and going still along by this riuer the space of three
dayes, seeking passage to passe ouer; and finding none, we were
at length inforced to cut timber to make a balsa or raft, which
when we had made, we sate on it, the Indians swimming in the
water, and thrusting it before them to the other side. Within
thirty dayes after, trauelling thorow woods, hiles, and mountaines,
we came to the mines of Sacatecas, which are the richest mines
in all the Indies, and from thence they fetch most siluer: at
which mines there dwelt aboue three hundred Christians: and
there our Captaine gaue vs leaue to depart. So we came to the
valley of S. Michael toward Mexico; and from thence to Pueblo
nouo; and from that place to the prouince of Mechuacan, after
which name the chiefest city of that place is called; where there
dwelles a bishop, and aboue an hundred Spanyards in it: it
aboundeth with all kind of Spanish fruits, and hath woods full
of nut trees, and wild vines. Heere are many mines of copper,
and great store of cattell. It lieth 60 leagues from Mexico,
whither we came within foure dayes after. The Indians of this
countrey are very mighty and big men.</p>

<p>Afterwards I returned another way to the prouince of Sonsonate
by Vera Cruz, and so to Rio Aluarado, and from thence
to the prouince of Campeche, which lieth on the South side of
the bay of Mexico; the chiefe towne of this prouince is called
Merida, in which is a bishop and almost 100 Spanyards. The
<!--165.png-->
<span class="pagenum">168</span>
Indians of this prouince pay all their tribute in mantles of cotton
wooll and cacao. There is no port in all this prouince for a ship
of 100 tun to ride in, but onely in the riuer of Tabasco, by which
riuer this city of Merida standeth. The chiefest merchandize
which they lade there in small frigats, is a certeine wood called
campeche, (wherewith they vse to die) as also hides and annile.
By this there lieth the prouince of Iucatan, nere the Honduras
by the North sea coast, where there is also another bishop, and
a towne likewise named Iucatan, where there dwell a few Spanyards.
They haue no force at all in all this coast to defend
themselues withall, saue only that the land is low, and there is
no port to receiue any shipping, vnlesse they be frigats, which
cary from thence to the port of S. Iohn de Vllua, waxe, cacao,
hony, and also mantles of cotton wool, whereof they make there
great store, and of which kind of merchandize there is great trade
thence to Mexico: of the same also they pay their tribute to the
king.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The greatnesse of the king of Spaines tribute out
of the West Indies.</span>
The king hath tribute brought him yerely out of the Indies
into Spaine betweene nine and ten millions of gold
and siluer: for he receiueth of euery Indian which is
subiect vnto him (excepting those which do belong
to the Incommenderos, which are the children of
those Spanyards, who first conquered the land, to
whom the king gaue and granted the gouernment of
the cities and townes subdued for three liues) twelue reals of
plate, and a hannege of maiz, which is a wheat of the countrey,
(fiue of them making a quarter of English measure) and of euery
widow woman he hath sixe reals, and halfe a hannege of maiz.
And so if any Indian haue twenty children in his house, he
payeth for euery one of them, being aboue fifteene yeres old,
after that rate. This Wheat being duely brought to the gouernour
of euery prouince and city, is sold in Mexico by the kings
gouernours there every yeere; so that the money receiued for it,
is put into the kings Treasurie there, and is so yeerely caried
from thence into Spaine.
<span class="sidenote">The quinta.</span>
Of the Spanyards which are owners
of the mines of gold and siluer, he receiueth the fift
part of it, which he calleth his quintas, which being
taken out of the heape, there is his armes set on it; for otherwise
it may not be brought out of the land into Spaine, vnder paine
of death. The marke of siluer, which is eight ounces, when it
commeth out of the mines, not hauing the kings seale vpon it,
<!--166.png-->
<span class="pagenum">169</span>
is woorth three and forty reals of plate, and so it is current: and
when they will bring it for Spaine, they cary it to the kings
Treasure house, where his seale is set vpon it; and so it is raised
in value thereby to threescore and foure reals of plate: and so
the king hath for his custome of euery marke of plate one and
twenty reals.</p>

<p>From the yere of 1570, which was the yeere that the Popes
buls came into the Indies, as is afore mentioned, he hath
receiued both of the Indians which are tributaries vnto him, and
also of all others belonging to the Incommenderos, of euery one
being aboue twelue yeeres of age, foure reals of euery bull.
Also they cary other pardons with them into the Indies, for such
as be dead, although an hundred yeres before the Spanyards
came into the countrey: which pardons the friers in their
preachings perswaded the poore Indians to take, telling them
that with giuing foure reals of plate for a Masse, they would
deliuer their soules out of purgatory. Of the Christians likewise
dwelling there he hath foureteene reals for euery bull: and there
be certeine buls brought thither for the Christians besides the
former, which serue for pardoning all such faults wherein they
haue trespassed either against the king, by keeping backe his
customes, or one against another by any other injury; for euery
hundred crownes whereof a mans conscience doth accuse him
that he hath deceiued the king or any other, he must giue ten
for a bull, and so after that rate for euery hundred which he
hath any way stollen, and so is pardoned the fault.
<span class="sidenote">The reuenue of the kings buls and pardons came
yerely to three millions.</span>
The reuenue of his buls after this maner yeeldeth
vnto his treasury yeerely aboue three millions of gold,
as I haue bene credibly informed, although of late
both the Spanyards and Indians do refuse to take
the buls; for that they perceiue he doth make a
yeerely custome of it: onely ech Indian taketh one pardon for
all his householde, (whereas in former time euery Indian vsed to
take one for euery person in his house) and teareth the same into
small pieces, and giueth to euery one of his householde a little
piece, saying thus, they need now no more, seeing in that which
they bought the yeere before they had aboue ten thousand
yeres pardon. These pieces they sticke vp in the wall of the
houses where they lie.
<span class="sidenote">Rebellions in Noua Hispania by two great
exactions.</span>
Both the Christians and Indians
are weary with these infinite taxes and customes, which of
late he hath imposed vpon them, more than in the yeeres

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
before: so as the people of both sorts did rebell
twise in the time that I was among them, and would
have set vp another king of themselues: for which
cause the king hath commanded vpon paine of
death, that they should not plant either oile or wine there, but
should alwayes stand in need of them to be brought out of
Spaine, although there would more grow there in foure yeeres
then there groweth in Spaine in twenty, it is so fertile a countrey.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The reasons which mooue the kings of Spaine to
forbid foren traffike in the West Indies.</span>
And the king to keepe the countrey alwayes in
subiection, and to his owne vse, hath streightly prouided
by lawe, vpon paine of death, and losse of
goods, that none of these countreys should traffique
with any other nation, although the people themselues
doe much now desire to trade with any other then
with them, and would vndoubtedly doe, if they
feared not the perill ensuing thereupon.</p>

<p>About Mexico, and other places in Noua Hispania, there
groweth a certaine plant called magueis, which yeeldeth wine,
vineger, hony, and blacke sugar, and of the leaues of it dried
they make hempe, ropes, shooes which they vse, and tiles for
their houses: and at the ende of euery leafe there groweth a
sharpe point like an awle, wherewith they vse to bore or pearce
thorow any thing.</p>

<p>Thus to make an end, I have heere set downe the summe of
all the chiefest things that I haue obserued and noted in my
seventeene yeres trauell in those parts.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2"><a name="a330" id="a330"></a>A relation of the commodities of Noua Hispania, and the maners
of the inhabitants, written by Henry Hawkes merchant,
which liued fiue yeeres in the sayd countrey, and drew the
same at the request of M. Richard Hakluyt Esquire of
Eton in the county of Hereford, 1572.</div>

<p>Saint Iohn de Vilua is an Island not high aboue the water,
where as now the Spanyards vpon M. Iohn Hawkins being there,
are in making a strong fort. In this place all the ships that
come out of Spaine with goods for these parts, do vnlade: for
they haue none other port so good as this is. The comming
into this place hath three chanels, and the best of all is the
Northermost, which goeth by the maine land: and on euery side
of the chanels there are many small rocks, as big as a small
<!--168.png-->
<span class="pagenum">171</span>
barrell: they wil make men stand in doubt of them, but there is
no feare of them. There is another Island there by, called The
Island of sacrifices, whereas the Spanyards did in times past
vnlade their goods: and for that, they say, there are vpon it
spirits or deuils, it is not frequented as it hath bene. In these
places the North wind hath so great dominion, that oftentimes it
destroyeth many ships and barks. This place is giuen to great
sicknesse. These Islands stand in 18 degrees and a halfe, and
about the same is great plenty of fish.</p>

<p>Fiue leagues from S. Iohn de Vllua is a faire riuer: it lieth
Northwest from the port, and goeth to a little towne of the
Spanyards called Vera Cruz, and with small vessels or barks,
which they call frigats, they cary all their merchandize which
commeth out of Spaine, to the said towne: and in like maner
bring all the gold, siluer, cochinilla, hides, and all other things
that the shippes cary into Spaine vnto them. And the goods
being in Vera Cruz, they carry them to Mexico, and to Pueblo
de los Angeles, Sacatecas, and Saint Martin, and diuers other
places so farre within the countrey, that some of them are 700
miles off, and some more, and some lesse, all vpon horses, mules,
and in waines drawen with oxen, and in carres drawen with
mules.</p>

<p>In this towne of Vera Cruz within these twenty yeres, when
women were brought to bed, the children new borne incontinently
died; which is not now in these dayes, God be thanked.</p>

<p>This towne is inclined to many kinde of diseases, by reason of
the great heat, and a certeine gnat or flie which they call a
mosquito, which biteth both men and women in their sleepe:
and assoone as they are bitten, incontinently the flesh swelleth as
though they had bene bitten with some venimous worme. And
this musquito or gnat doth most follow such as are newly come
into the countrey. Many there are that die of this
annoyance.</p>

<p>This towne is situated vpon the riuer aforesayd, and compassed
with woods of diuers maners and sorts, and many fruits, as
orenges and limons, guiaues, and diuers others, and birds in
them, popinjayes both small and great, and some of them as big
as a rauen, and their tailes as long as the taile of a fezant. There
are also many other kinde of birds of purple colour, and small
munkeys, maruellous proper.</p>

<p>This hote or sicke countrey continueth fiue and forty miles
<!--169.png-->
<span class="pagenum">172</span>
towards the city of Mexico; and the fiue and forty miles being
passed, then there is a temperate countrey, and full of tillage:
but they water all their corn with riuers which they turn in upon
it. And they gather their Wheat twise a yere. And if they
should not water the ground where as their corne is sowen, the
country is so hote it would burne all.</p>

<p>Before you come to Mexico, there is a great towne called
Tlaxcalla, which hath in it aboue 16000 households. All the
inhabitants thereof are free by the kings of Spaine: for these
were the occasion that Mexico was woone in so short time, and
with so little losse of men. Wherefore they are all gentlemen,
and pay no tribute to the king. In this towne is all the cochinilla
growing.</p>

<p>Mexico is a great city; it hath more then fifty thousand
households, whereof there are not past fiue or sixe thousand
houses of Spanyards: all the other are the people of the countrey,
which liue vnder the Spanyards lawes. There are in this city
stately buildings, and many monasteries of friers and nunnes,
which the Spanyards haue made. And the building of the
Indians is somewhat beautifull outwardly, and within full of
small chambers, with very small windowes, which is not so comly
as the building of the Spanyards. This city standeth in the
midst of a great lake, and the water goeth thorow all or the most
part of the streets, and there come small boats, which they call
canoas, and in them they bring all things necessary, as wood, and
coales, and grasse for their horses, stones and lime to build, and
corne.</p>

<p>This city is subject to many earthquakes, which oftentimes
cast downe houses, and kil people. This city, is very well prouided
of water to drinke, and with all maner of victuals, as fruits,
flesh and fish, bread, hennes and capons, Guiny cocks and
hennes and all other fowle. There are in this city euery weeke
three Faires or Markets, which are frequented with many
people, aswell Spanyards as the people of the countrey. There
are in these Faires or Markets all maner of things that may be
inuented, to sell, and in especiall, things of the countrey. The
one of these Faires is vpon the Munday; which is called S.
Hypolitos faire, and S. Iames his faire is vpon the Thursday, and
vpon Saturday is S. Iohns faire. In this city is alwayes the kings
gouernour or viceroy, and there are kept the Termes or
Parliaments. And although there be other places of iustice, yet
<!--170.png-->
<span class="pagenum">173</span>
this is aboue all: so that all men may appeale vnto this place,
and may not appeale from this city, but onely into Spaine before
the king: and it must be for a certeine sum: and if it be vnder
that summe, then there is no appellation from them. Many
riuers fall into this lake which the city standeth in: but there
was neuer any place found wither it goeth out.</p>

<p>The Indians know a way to drowne the city, and within these
three yeeres they would haue practised the same: but they
which should haue bene the doers of it were hanged: and euer
since the city hath bene well watched both day and night, for
feare lest at some time they might be deceiued: for the Indians
loue not the Spanyards. Round about the towne there are very
many gardens and orchards of the fruits of the countrey, maruellous
faire, where the people haue great recreation. The men of this
city are maruellous vicious; and in like maner the women are
dishonest of their bodies, more then they are in other cities or
townes in this countrey.</p>

<p>There are neere about this city of Mexico many riuers and
standing waters, which haue in them a monstrous kinde of fish,
which is maruellous rauening, and a great deuourer of men and
cattell. He is woont to sleepe vpon the drie land many times,
and if there come in the meane time any man or beast and
wake or disquiet him, he speedeth well if he get from him. He
is like vnto a serpent, sauing that he doth not flie, neither hath
he wings.</p>

<p>There is West out of Mexico a port towne which is on the
South sea, called Puerto de Acapulco, where as there are shippes
which they haue ordinarily for the nauigation of China, which
they haue newly found. This port is threescore leagues from
Mexico.</p>

<p>There, is another port towne which is called Culiacan, on the
South sea, which lieth West and by North out of Mexico, and is
200 leagues from the same: and there the Spanyards made two
ships to goe seeke the streight or gulfe, which, as they say, is
betweene the Newfoundland and Groenland; and they call it the
Englishmens streight: which as yet was neuer fully found. They
say, that streight lieth not farre from the maine land of China,
which the Spanyards account to be maruellous rich.</p>

<p>Toward the North from Mexico there are great store of siluer
mines. There, is greater quantitie of siluer found in these mines
toward the North, then there is any other parts: and as the most
<!--171.png-->
<span class="pagenum">174</span>
men of experience sayde alwayes, they finde the richer mines the
more Northerly. These mines are commonly vpon great hilles
and stony ground, maruellous hard to be laboured and wrought.</p>

<p>Out of some of the mines the Indians finde a certeine kinde
of earth of diuers colours, wherewith they paint themselues in
times of their dances, and other pastimes which they vse.</p>

<p>In this countrey of Noua Hispania there are also mines of
golde, although the golde be commonly found in riuers, or very
neere vnto riuers. And nowe in these dayes there is not so much
golde found as there hath bene heretofore.</p>

<p>There are many great riuers, and great store of fish in them,
not like vnto our kindes of fish. And there are maruellous great
woods, and as faire trees as may be seene, of diuers sorts, and
especially firre trees, that may mast any shippe that goeth vpon
the sea, oakes and pineapples, and another tree which they call
Mesquiquez: it beareth a fruit like vnto a peascod, maruellous
sweet, which the wilde people gather, and keepe it all the yere,
and eat it in stead of bread.</p>

<p>The Spanyards haue notice of seuen cities which old men of
the Indians shew them should lie towards the Northwest from
Mexico. They haue vsed and vse dayly much diligence in
seeking of them, but they cannot find any one of them. They
say that the witchcraft of the Indians is such, that when they
come by these townes they cast a mist vpon them, so that they
cannot see them.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Pedro Morales and Nicolas Burgignon write the like
of Copalla.</span>
They haue understanding of another city which
they call Copalla: and in like maner, at my beeing in
the countrey, they haue vsed much labour and diligence
in the seeking of it: they haue found the lake
on which it should stand, and a canoa, the head
whereof was wrought with copper curiously, and could not finde
nor see any man nor the towne, which to their vnderstanding
should stand on the same water, or very neere the same.</p>

<span class="sidenote">The strange oxen of Cibola.</span>
There is a great number of beasts or kine in the
countrey of Cibola, which were neuer brought thither
by the Spanyards, but breed naturally in the countrey.
They are like vnto our oxen, sauing that they haue long haire
like a lion, and short hornes, and they haue upon their shoulders
a bunch like a camell, which is higher then the rest of their body.
They are maruellous wild and swift in running. They call them
the beasts or kine of Cibola.</p>

<p><!--172.png--><span class="pagenum">175</span>
<span class="sidenote">Cibola abandoned.</span>
This Cibola is a city which the Spanyards found
now of late, without any people in the same, goodly
buildings, faire chimneys, windowes made of stone
and timber excellently wrought, faire welles with wheeles to draw
their water, and a place where they had buried their dead people,
with many faire stones vpon the graues. And the captaine would
not suffer his souldiers to brake vp any parte of these graues,
saying, he would come another time to do it.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A great riuer near Cibola.</span>
They asked certeine people which they met,
whither the people of this city were gone: and they
made answer, they were gone downe a riuer, which
was there by, very great, and there builded a city which was
more for their commodity.</p>

<p>This captaine lacking things necessary for himselfe and his
men, was faine to return backe againe, without finding any
treasure according to his expectation: neither found they but
fewe people, although they found beaten wayes, which had beene
much haunted and frequented. The captaine at his comming
backe againe, had a great checke of the gouernour, because he
had not gone forwards, and seene the end of that riuer.</p>

<p>They haue in the countrey, farre from the sea side, standing
waters, which are salt: and in the moneths of April and
May the water of them congealeth into salt, which salt is all
taken for the kings vs and profit.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Dogs of India described.</span>
Their dogs are all crooked backt, as many are of
the countrey breed, and cannot run fast: their faces
are like the face of a pig or an hog, with sharpe
noses.</p>

<p>In certeine prouinces which are called Guatimala, and
Soconusco, there is growing great store of cacao, which is a
berry like vnto an almond: it is the best merchandize that is in
all the Indies. The Indians make drinke of it, and in like maner
meat to eat. It goeth currently for money in any market or
faire, and may buy an flesh, fish, bread or cheese, or other
things.</p>

<p>There are many kinde of fruits of the countrey, which are
very good, as plantans, sapotes, guianes, pinas, aluacatas, tunas,
mamios, limons, grapes which the Spanyards brought into the
countrey, and also wild grapes, which are of the country, and very
small, quinses, peaches, figs, and but few apples, and very small,
and no peares: but there are melons and calaba&ccedil;s or gourds.</p>

<p><!--173.png--><span class="pagenum">176</span></p>

<p>There is much hony, both of bees and also of a kind of tree
which they call magueiz. This hony of magueiz is not so
sweet as the other hony, but it is better to be eaten only with
bread, then the other is; and the tree serueth for many things, as
the leaves make threed to sowe any kind of bags, and are good
to couer and thatch houses, and for diuers other things.</p>

<p>They haue in diuers places of the countrey many hote springs
of water: as aboue all other, I haue seen one in the prouince of
Mechuacan. In a plaine field without any mountaine, there is a
spring which hath much water, and it is so hot, that if a whole
quarter of beefe be cast into it, within an halfe houre it will be
as well sodden as it will be ouer a fire in halfe a day. I haue
seene halfe a sheepe cast in it, and immediately it hath bene
sodden, and I haue eaten part of it.</p>

<p>There are many hares, and some conies. There are no partridges,
but abundance of quailes.</p>

<p>They haue great store of fish in the South sea, and many
oisters, and very great. The people do open the oisters, and
take out the meat of them, and dry it as they do any other kinde
of fish, and keepe them all the yeere: and when the times serue,
they send them abroad into the country to sell, as all other fish.
They haue no salmon, nor trowt, nor pele, nor crape, tench, nor
pike in all the countrey.</p>

<p>There are in the countrey mighty high mountaines, and hilles,
and snow upon them: they commonly burne; and twise every
day they cast out much smoke and ashes at certeine open places,
which are in the tops of them.</p>

<p>There is among the wilde people much manna. I haue
gathered of the same, and haue eaten it, and it is good: for the
Apothecaries send their seruants at certeine times, to gather of
the same for purgations and other vses.</p>

<p>There are in the mountaines many wilde hogs, which all men
kill, and lions and tygres; which tygres do much harm to men
that trauell in the wildernesse.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Mines discouered, not found againe.</span>
In this countrey, not long since, there were two poore men
that found a maruellous rich mine; and when these men went to
make a register of the same (according to the law and custom)
before the kings officers, they thought this mine not meet for
such men as they were: and violently took the sayd
mine for the king; and gaue no part thereof vnto the
two poore men. And within certaine dayes the kings
<!--174.png-->
<span class="pagenum">177</span>
officers resorted thither to labor in the mine, and they found two
great mighty hilles were come together; so they found no place
to worke in.
<span class="sidenote">The authour fiue yeeres in Nueua Espanna.</span>
And in the time while I was among them, which
was fiue yeeres, there was a poore shepheard, who
keeping his sheepe, happened to finde a well of
quicke-siluer; and he went in like maner to manifest
the same, as the custome and maner is; the
kings officers dealt in like order as they did with the two poore
men that found the rich mine, taking it quite from the shepheard:
but when they went to fetch home the quicke-siluer, or part
thereof, they could neuer finde it againe. So these things haue
bene declared vnto the king, who hath giuen commandement,
that nothing being found in the fields, as mines, and such like,
shall be taken away from any man. And many other things haue
bene done in this countrey, which men might count for great
maruels.</p>

<p>There is a great abundance of sugar here, and they make
diuers conserues, and very good, and send them to Peru, where
as they sell them maruellous well, because they make none in
those parts.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Description of the Indians person and maner.</span>
The people of the countrey are of good stature,
tawny coloured, broad faced, flat nosed, and giuen
much to drinke both wine of Spaine and also a certeine
kind of wine which they make with hony of
Maguiez, and roots, and other things which they vse to put into
the same. They call the same wine Pulco. They are soone
drunke, and giuen to much beastlinesse, and void of all goodnesse.
In their drunkennesse, they vse and commit Sodomy;
and with their mothers and daughters they haue their pleasures
and pastimes. Whereupon they are defended from the drinking
of wines, vpon paines of money, aswell he that selleth the wines
as the Indian that drinketh the same. And if this commandement
were not, all the wine in Spaine and in France were not
sufficient for the West Indies onely.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The people of Nueua Espanna great cowards.</span>
They are of much simplicity, and great cowards, voide of all
valour, and are great witches. They vse diuers times
to take with the diuell, to whom they do certaine
sacrifices and oblations: many times they haue bene
taken with the same, and I haue seene them most
cruelly punished for that offence.</p>

<p>The people are giuen to learn all maner of occupations and
<!--175.png-->
<span class="pagenum">178</span>
sciences, which for the most part they learned since the coming
of the Spanyards: I say all maner of arts. They are very artificiall
in making of images with feathers, or the proportion or
figure of any man, in all kind of maner as he is. The finenesse
and excellency of this is woonderfull, that a barbarous people as
they are, should giue themselues to so fine an arte as this is.
They are goldsmiths, blackesmiths, and coppersmiths, carpenters,
masons, shoomakers, tailors, sadlers, imbroderers, and of all
other kind of sciences: and they will do worke so good cheape,
that poore young men that goe out of Spaine to get their liuing,
are not set on worke: which is the occasion there are many idle
people in the countrey. For the Indian will liue all the weeke
with lesse then one groat: which the Spanyard cannot do, nor
any man els.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The Indians ignorance from whence they came.</span>
They say, that they came of the linage of an olde man which
came thither in a boat of wood, which they call a canoa.
But they cannot tell whether it were before
the flood or after, neither can they giue any reason
of the flood, nor from whence they came. And
when the Spanyards came first among them, they did
certeine sacrifice to an image made in stone, of their owne inuention.
The stone was set vpon a great hill, which they made of
bricks of earth: they call it their Cowa. And certeine dayes in
the yere they did sacrifice, certeine olde men, and yoong children:
and onely beleeued in the Sunne and the Moone, saying, that
from them they had all things that were needful for them. They
haue in these parts great store of cotton wool, with which they
make a maner of linen cloth, which the Indians weare, both men
and women, and it serueth for shirts and smocks, and all other
kind of garments, which they weare vpon their bodies: and the
Spanyards vse it to all such purposes, especially such as cannot
buy other. And if it were not for this kind of cloth, all maner
of cloth that goeth out of Spaine, I say linnen cloth, would be
solde out of all measure.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The wilde Indians.</span>
The wilde people go naked, without any thing vpon them.
The women weare the skinne of a deere before their
priuities, and nothing els vpon all their bodies.
They haue no care for any thing, but onely from day
to day for that which they haue need to eat. They are big men,
and likewise the women. They shoot in bowes which they make
of a cherry tree, and their arrowes are of cane, with a sharpe
<!--176.png-->
<span class="pagenum">179</span>
flint stone in the end of the same; they will pierce any coat of
maile: and they kill deere, and cranes, and wilde geese, ducks,
and other fowle, and wormes, and snakes, and diuers other
vermin, which they eat. They liue very long: for I haue seene
men that haue beene an hundred yeres of age. They haue but
very litle haire in their face, nor on their bodies.</p>

<p>The Indians haue the friers in great reuerence: the occasion
is, that by them and by there meanes they are free and out of
bondage; which was so ordeined by Charles the emperor: which
is the occasion that now there is not so much gold and siluer
comming into Europe as there was while the Indians were slaues.
For when they were in bondage they could not chuse but doe
their taske euery day, and bring their master so much metall out
of their mines: but now they must be well payed, and much
intreated to haue them worke. So it hath bene, and is a great
hinderance to the owners of the mines, and to the kings quinto
or custome.</p>

<p>There are many mines of copper in great quantity, whereof
they spend in the countrey as much as serueth their turnes.
There is some golde in it, but not so much as will pay the costs
of the fining. The quantity of it is such, and the mines are so
farre from the sea, that it will not be worth the fraight to cary it
into Spaine. On the other side, the kings officers will giue no
licence to make ordinance thereof; whereupon the mines lie vnlaboured,
and of no valuation.</p>

<p>There is much lead in the countrey; so that with it they couer
churches, and other religious houses: wherefore they shall not
need any of our lead, as they haue had need thereof in times
past.</p>

<p>The pompe and liberalitie of the owners of the mines is maruellous
to beholde: the apparell both of them and of their wiues
is more to be compared to the apparell of noble persons then
otherwise. If their wiues go out of their houses, as vnto the
church, or any other place, they goe out with great maiesty, and
with as many men and maids as though she were the wife of
some noble man. I will assure you, I haue seene a miners wife
goe to the church with an hundred men, and twenty gentlewomen
and maids. They keepe open house: who will, may
come and eat their meat. They call men with a bell to come to
dinner and supper. They are princes in keeping of their houses,
and bountifull in all maner of things.</p>

<p><!--177.png--><span class="pagenum">180</span>
<span class="sidenote">Things necessary to mines of siluer and
golde.</span>
A good owner of mines must haue at the least an
hundred slaues to cary and to stampe his metals; he
must haue many mules, and men to keepe the mines;
he must haue milles to stampe his metals; he must
haue many waines and oxen to bring home wood to fine the oare;
he must haue much quicke-siluer, and a maruellous quantity of
salt-brine for the metals; and he must be at many other charges.
And as for this charge of quicke-siluer, it is a new inuention,
which they finde more profitable then to fine their oare with lead.
Howbeit the same is very costly: for there is neuer a hundred of
quicke-siluer but costeth at the least threescore pounds sterling.
And the mines fall dayly in decay, and of lesse value: and the
occasion is, the few Indians that men haue to labour their mines.</p>

<p>There is in New Spaine a maruellous increase of cattle, which
daily do increase, and they are of a greater growth then ours are.
You may haue a great steere that hath an hundred weight of
tallow in his belly for sixteene shillings; and some one man hath
2000 head of cattel of his owne. They sell the hides vnto the
merchants, who lade into Spaine as many as may be well spared.
They spend many in the countrey in shoes and boots, and in the
mines: and as the countrey is great, so is the increase of the
cattell woonderfull. In the Island of Santo Domingo they commonly
kill the beasts for their hides and tallow; and the fowles
eat the carkeises: and so they do in Cuba and Porto Rico,
whereas there is much sugar, and cana fistula, which dayly they
send into Spaine. They have great increase of sheep in like
maner, and dayly do intend to increase them. They have much
wooll, and as good as the wooll of Spaine. They make cloth as
much as serueth the countrey, for the common people, and send
much cloth into Peru. I haue seene cloth made in the city
of Mexico, which hath beene solde for tenne pezos a vare, which
is almost foure pounds English, and the vare is less then our
yard. They haue woad growing in the countrey, and allum, and
brasill, and diuers other things to die withall, so that they make
all colours. In Peru they make no cloth: but heereafter our
cloth will be little set by in these parts, vnlesse it be some fine
cloth. The wools are commonly foure shillings euery roue,
which is fiue and twenty pounds: and in some places of the
countrey that are farre from the places where as they make cloth,
it is woorth nothing, and doth serue but onely to make beds for
men to lie on.</p>

<p><!--178.png--><span class="pagenum">181</span></p>

<p>They make hats, as many as do serue the Countrey, very fine
and good, and sell them better cheape, then they can be brought
out of Spaine, and in like maner send them into Peru.</p>

<p>Many people are set on worke both in the one and in the
other: they spin their wooll as we doe, and in steed of oyle, they
haue hogs grease: they twist not their threed so much as wee doe,
neither worke so fine a threed. They make kersies, but they
make much cloth, which is course, and sell it for lesse than 12.
pence the vare. It is called Sayall.</p>

<p>They haue much silke, and make all maner of sorts thereof, as
Taffataes, Sattins, Veluets of all colours, and they are as good as
the silkes of Spaine, sauing that the colours are not so perfect:
but the blackes are better then the blackes that come out of Spaine.</p>

<p>They haue many horses, and mares, and mules, which the
Spaniards brought thither. They haue as good Iennets, as any
are in Spaine, and better cheape then they bee in Spaine.
And with their mules they cary all their goods from place to place.</p>

<p>There is raine vsually in this Countrey, from the moneth of
May, to the midst of October, euery day, which time they call
their winter, by reason of the said waters. And if it were not for
the waters which fall in these hot seasons, their Maiz, which is
the greatest part of their sustenance, would be destroyed. This
Maiz is the greatest maintenance which the Indian hath, and
also all the common people of the Spaniards. And their horses
and mules which labour, cannot be without the same. This
graine is substantiall, and increaseth much blood. If the Miners
should bee without it, they coulde not labour their mines: for all
their seruants eate none other bread, but onely of this Maize,
and it is made in cakes, as they make oaten cakes, in some places
of England.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">An Hanega is a bushel and an halfe.</span>
The Indians pay tribute, being of the age of 20.
yeeres, 4. shillings of money, and an hanege of Maiz,
which is worth 4. shillings more vnto the king euery
yeere. This is payd in all Noua Hispania, of as
many as be of the age of 20. yeeres, sauing the citie of Tlascalla,
which was made free because the citizens thereof were the
occasion that Cortes tooke Mexico in so little a time.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And
<!--179.png-->
<span class="pagenum">182</span>
although at the first they were freed from painment of tribute,
yet the Spaniards now begin to vsurpe vpon them, and make
them to till a great field of Maiz, at their owne costes euery
yeere for the King, which is as beneficial vnto him, and as great
cost vnto them, as though they paid their tribute, as the others doe.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
The Republic of Tlascala had at first opposed the Spaniards on their
advance to Mexico, but being defeated, became their allies and remained
true to them throughout the troublous period of the evacuation and siege of the
Capital.</div>

<p>The ships which goe out of Spaine with goods for Peru, goe to
Nombre de Dios, and there discharge the said goods: and from
thence they be carried ouer the necke of a land, vnto a port
towne in the South sea, called Panama, which is 17. leagues
distant from Nombre de Dios. And there they doe ship their
goods againe and so from thence goe to Peru. They are in
going thither three moneths, and they come backe againe in 20.
dayes. They haue seldome foule weather, and fewe ships are
lost in the South sea.
<span class="sidenote">Salomons Islands, sought and found in the South
Sea 1588.</span>
Foure yeeres past, to wit 1568,
there
was a ship made out of Peru, to seeke Salomons
Islands, and they came somewhat to the South of the
Equinoctial, and found an Island with many blacke
people, in such number that the Spaniards durst not
go on land among them. And because they had
bene long vpon the voyage, their people were very weake, and so
went not on land, to know what commoditie was vpon it. And
for want of victuals, they arriued in Noua Hispania, in a port
called Puerto de Nauidad, and thence returned backe againe
vnto Peru, whereas they were euil entreated, because they had
not knowen more of the same Island.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">China found by the West.</span>
They haue in this port of Nauidad ordinarily their ships, which
goe to the Islands of China,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which are certaine
Islands which they haue found within these 7. yeres.
They haue brought from thence gold, and much
Cinamon, and dishes of earth, and cups of the same, so fine, that
euery man that may haue a piece of them, will giue the weight
of siluer for it. There was a Mariner that brought a pearle as
big as a doues egge from thence, and a stone, for which the
Viceroy would haue giuen 3000 duckets. Many
things they bring from thence, most excellent. There
are many of these ylands, and the Spaniards haue
not many of them as yet:
<span class="sidenote">This is to be understood of the time when this
discourse was written, Anno 1572.</span>
for the Portugals disturbe
them much, and combate with them euery day,
saying, it is part of their conquest, and to the maine
land they cannot come at any hand. There are
<!--180.png-->
<span class="pagenum">183</span>
goodly people in them, and they are great Mariners, richly
apparelled in cloth of gold, and siluer, and silke of all sorts,
and goe apparelled after the maner of the Turkes. This
report make such as come from thence.
<span class="sidenote">China ships with one saile.</span>
The men of the
maine land haue certeine traffique with some of these ylanders,
and come thither in a kind of ships, which they haue with one
saile, and bring of such marchandize as they haue
need of. And of these things there haue bene
brought into New Spaine both cloth of gold and
siluer, marueilous to be seene. So by their saying, there is not
such a countrey in the whole world. The maine land is from
the ylands 190. leagues: and the ylands are not farre from the
Malucos Northwards. And the people of these ylands, which the
Spaniards haue, say, that if they would bring their wiues and
children, that then they should haue among them what they
would haue. So there goe women dayly, and the king payeth all
the charges of the maried men and their wiues, that go to these
ylands. And there is no doubt but the trade will be marueilous
rich in time to come. It was my fortune to be in company with
one Diego Gutieres, who was the first Pilot that euer went to that
countrey of the Phillippinas. Hee maketh report of many
strange things in that Countrey, as well riches as other, and
saith, if there bee any Paradise vpon earth, it is in that
countrey: and addeth, that sitting vnder a tree, you shall haue
such sweet smels, with such great content and pleasure, that you
shall remember nothing, neither wife, nor children, nor haue any
kinde of appetite to eate or drinke, the odoriferous smels wil be
so sweete. This man hath good liuings in Noua Hispania, notwithstanding
hee will returne thither, with his wife and children,
and as for treasure there is abundance, as he maketh mention.
In this countrey of Noua Hispania there are many buckes and
does, but they haue not so long hornes as they haue here
in England. The Spaniards kill them with hand guns, and with
greyhounds, and the Indians kill them with their bowes and
arrowes, and with the skins they make chamoyce, such as we
in England make doublets and hose of, as good as the skins that
are dressed in Flanders and likewise they make
marueilous good Spanish leather of them.
<span class="sidenote">Indian Rauens not killed, to deuoure

There is a
bird which is like vnto a Rauen, but he hath some

them, that they eate all the corrupt and dead flesh
<!--181.png-->
<span class="pagenum">184</span>
which is in the countrey. Otherwise the abundance of carren is so
much, that it would make a marueilous corrupt aire in all the
countrey, and be so noisome, that no man could abide it.
Therefore it is commanded there shall none of them be killed.
These birds are alwayes about cities and townes, where there is
much flesh killed.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Wrong done to the Indians punished.</span>
The Indians are much favoured by the Iustices of the
Countrey, and they call them their orphanes. And
if any Spaniard should happen to doe any of them
harme, or to wrong him in taking any thing from him,
as many times they doe, or to strike any of them,
being in any towne, whereas iustice is, they are as well punished
for the same, as if they had done it one Spaniard to another.
When a Spaniard is farre from Mexico, or any place of iustice,
thinking to doe with the poore Indian what he list, considering
he is so farre from any place of remedy, he maketh the Indian
do what he commandeth him, and if he will not doe it, hee
beateth and misuseth him, according to his owne appetite. The
Indian holdeth his peace, vntill he finde an opportunitie, and
then taketh a neighbor with him, and goeth to Mexico, although
it be 20. leagues off and maketh his complaint. This his
complaint is immediately heard, and although it be a knight, or
a right good gentleman, he is forthwith sent for, and punished,
both by his goods, and also his person is imprisoned, at the
pleasure of the Iustice.
<span class="sidenote">Iustice the cause of ciuilitie.</span>
This is the occasion that the
Indians are so tame and ciuil, as they are: and if
they should not haue this fauour, the Spaniards would
soone dispatch all the Indians, or the Indians would kill them.
But they may call them dogs and vse other euil words, as much
they will, and the Indian must needes put it vp, and goe his way.</p>

<p>The poore Indians wil go euery day two or three leagues to a
faire or market with a childe vpon their necks, with as much
fruit or rootes, or some kind of ware, as cotton wooll, or cadis of
all colours, as shall be not worth a pennie: and they will
mainteine themselues vpon the same. For they liue with a
marueillous small matter.</p>

<p>They are in such pouertie, that if you neede to ride into the
Countrey, you shall haue an Indian to goe with you all the day with
your bed upon his backe, for one royall of plate: and this you
shall haue from one towne to another. Here you are to vnderstand,
that all men that traueile by the way, are alwayes wont to
<!--182.png-->
<span class="pagenum">185</span>
carry their beds with them. They are great theeues, and wil
steale all that they may, and you shall haue no recompence at
their hands.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The apparel of the Indians.</span>
The garments of the women, are in this maner.
The vppermost part is made almost like to a womans
smocke, sauing that it is as broade aboue as beneath,
and hath no sleeues, but holes on eche side one to put out their
armes. It is made of linnen cloth made of cotton wooll, and
filled full of flowers, of red cadis and blew, and other colours.
This garment commeth downe to the knees, and then they haue
cloth made after the same maner, and then they goeth rounde
about their waste, and reacheth to their shooes and ouer this a
white fine sheet vpon their heads, which goeth downe halfe the
legge. Their haire is made vp round with an haire lace about
their head. And the men haue a small paire of breaches of the
same cotton wooll, and their shirts which hang ouer their
breeches, and a broad girdle about their middles, and a sheete
with flowers vpon their backes, and with a knot vpon one
shoulder and an hat vpon their heads, and a paire of shoes.
And this is all their apparell, although it be a Casique, which
they vse in all the Countrey.</p>

<p>The wals of the houses of the Indians, are but plaine, but the
stones are layd so close, that you shall not well perceiue the
ioynts betweene one stone and another, they are so finely cut:
and by the meanes that the stones are so workmanly done, and
finely ioyned together, there is some beautie in their wals. They
are marueilous small and light, as Pumic stones. They make
their doores very little, so that there can go in but one man at a
time. Their windowes and roomes within their houses are small,
and one roome they haue reserued for their friends, when they
come to talke one with another, and that is alwayes faire matted,
and kept marueilous cleane, and hanged full of images, and their
chaires standing there to sit in. They eate their meate vpon the
ground, and sleepe on the ground vpon a mat, without any bed,
both the gentlemen, and other.</p>

<p>The Indians strike their fire with one sticke in another, aswell
the tame people, as the wilde. For they know not how to do it
with an yron, and a stone.</p>

<span class="sidenote">Mutezuma, and his riches.</span>
Mutezuma which was the last King of this Countrey, was one
of the richest princes which haue bene seene in our
time, or long before. He had all kinde of beasts
which were then in the countrey, and all maner of
birdes, and fishes, and all maner of wormes, which creepe vpon
the earth, and all trees, and flowers, and herbes, all fashioned in
siluer and golde, which was the greatest part of al his treasure,
and in these things had he great ioy, as the old Indians report.
And vnto this day, they say that the treasure of Mutezuma is
hidden, and that the Spaniards haue it not. This King would
giue none of his people freedome, nor forgiue any of them
that should pay him tribute, though he were neuer so poore.
For if it had bene told him that one of his tributaries was
poore, and that he was not able to pay his tribute according
to the custome, then he would haue him bound to bring at such
times as tributes should be payd, a quill full of Lice, saying, hee
would haue none free, but himselfe. He had as many wiues or
concubines, as hee would haue, and such as liked him.
<span class="sidenote">The Indians wash themselues euery day.</span>
Alwayes
whensoeuer he went out of his Court to passe the time, he was
borne vpon 4 of his noble mens shoulders set vpon a table, some
say, of golde, and very richly dressed with feathers of
diuers and many colours and flowers. He washed
all his body euery day, were it neuer so cold. And
vnto this day so do all the Indians, and especially the
women.</p>

<p>The Spaniards keepe the Indians in great subjection. They
may haue in their houses no sword nor dagger, nor knife with
any point, nor may weare vpon them any maner of armes,
neither may they ride vpon any horse nor mules, in any sadle nor
bridle, neither may they drinke wine, which they take for the
greatest paine of all. They haue attempted diuers times to
make insurrections, but they haue bene ouerthrowen immediatly
by their owne great and beastly cowardlinesse.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

coast of England, with the number and names of the
ships, their Captaines and Masters, and of our trafique

<p>
<span class="sidenote">This fleet consisted of 6 ships.</span>
Vpon Munday the second of October 1567. the
weather being reasonable faire, our Generall M. Iohn
Hawkins, hauing commanded all his Captaines and
Masters to be in a readinesse to make sail with him, hee himselfe
being imbarked in the Iesus, whereof was appointed for Master
Robert Barret, hoised saile, and departed from Plymouth vpon
his intended voyage for the parts of Africa, and America, being
<!--185.png-->
<span class="pagenum">188</span>
accompanied with fiue other saile of ships, as namely the
Mynion, wherein went for Captaine M. Iohn Hampton, and Iohn
Garret Master. The William and Iohn, wherein was Captaine
Thomas Bolton, and Iames Raunce Master. The Iudith, in
whom was Captaine M. Francis Drake afterward knight, and the
Angel, whose Master, as also the Captaine and Master of the
Swallow I now remember not. And so sayling in company
together vpon our voyage vntil the tenth of the same
moneth, an extreeme storme then tooke vs neere vnto Cape
Finister, which dured for the space of foure dayes, and so
separated our ships, that wee had lost one another, and our
Generall finding the Iesus to bee but in ill case, was in minde to
giue over the voyage, and to returne home. Howbeit the
eleuenth of the same moneth the Seas waxing calme, and the
winde comming faire, he altered his purpose, and held on the
former intended voyage: And so comming to the yland of Gomera
being one of the ylands of the Canaries, where according to an
order before appointed, we met with all our ships which were
before dispersed, wee then took in fresh water and departed from
thence the fourth of Nouember, and holding on our course, vpon
the eightenth day of the same moneth wee came to an ancker vpon
the coast of Africa, at Cape Verde in twelue fadome water; and here
our Generall landed certaine of our men, to the number of 160. or
thereabout, seeking to take some Negros. And they going vp
into the Countrey for the space of sixe miles, were encountred
with a great number of the Negros: who with their enuenomed
arrowes did hurt a great number of our men, so that they were
inforced to retire to the ships, in which conflict they recouered
but a few Negros, and of these our men which were hurt with
their enuenomed arrowes, there died to the number of seuen or
eight in very strange maner, with their mouths shut, so that wee
were forced to put stickes and other things into their mouths to
keepe them open,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and so afterward passing the time vpon the
coast of Guinea, until the twelfth of Ianuary, we obteined by that
time the number of 150. Negros. And being ready to depart
from the Sea coast, there was a Negro sent as an Ambassadour
to our Generall, from a King of the Negros, which was oppressed
with other Kings his bordering neighbours, desiring our Generall
to grant him succour and ayde against those his enemies, which
<!--186.png-->
<span class="pagenum">189</span>
our Generall granted vnto, and went himselfe in person a lande,
with the number of two hundreth of our men or thereabouts, and
the said King which had requested our ayde, did ioyne his force
with ours, so that thereby our Generall assaulted, and set fire
vpon a Towne of the said King his enemies, in which there was
at the least the number of eight or ten thousand Negros, and
they perceiuing that they were not able to make any resistance
sought by flight to saue themselues, in which their flight there
were taken prisoners to the number of eight or nine hundreth,
which our Generall ought to haue had for his share: howbeit
the Negro King which requested our ayde, falsifying his word
and promise, secretly in the night conueyed himselfe away with
as many prisoners as he had in his custodie: but our Generall
notwithstanding finding himselfe to haue nowe very neere the
number of 500. Negros thought it best without longer abode to
depart with them, and such marchandize as hee had from the
coast of Africa, towards the West Indies,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and therefore commanded
with all diligence to take in fresh water and
fewel, and so with speed to prepare to depart.
<span class="sidenote">The William and Iohn separated and neuer after met

Howbeit before we departed from thence, in a storme

we heard no tidings during the time of our voyage.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Wherein is shewed the day and time of our departure from the
coast of Africa, with the day and time of our arriuall in
the West Indies, also of our trade, and trafique their, and
also of the great crueltie that the Spaniards vsed towards
vs, by the Vice-roy his direction, and appointment, falsifying
his faith and promise giuen, and seeking to haue
intrapped vs.</div>

<p>All things being made in a readinesse, at our Generall his
appointment, vpon the thirde day of Februarie 1568, wee
departed from the coast of Africa, hauing the weather somewhat
tempestuous, which made our passage the more hard; and
sayling so for the space of 52. dayes, vpon the 27 of March
<!--187.png--><span class="pagenum">
190</span>1568. we came in sight of an yland called Dominica, vpon the
coast of America in the West Indies, situated in
14. degrees latitude,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and 322. of longitude: from thence our Generall coasted
from place to place, euer making trafique with the Spaniards
and Indians as hee might, which was somewhat hardly obtained,
for that the King had straightly charged all his gouernours in
those parts not to trade with any: yet notwithstanding, during
the moneths of April and May, our Generall had reasonable
trade and trafique, and courteous entertainement in sundry
places, as at Margarita, Cora&ccedil;ao, and else where, til we came,
to Cape de la vela,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and Rio de Hacha,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (a place from whence all
the pearles doe come:) the gouernour there would not by any
meanes permit vs to haue any trade or trafique, nor yet suffer vs
to take in fresh water: by meanes whereof our Generall for the
auoyding of famine and thirst about the beginning of Iune, was
enforced to land two hundreth of our men, and so by maine
force and strength to obtaine that which by no faire meanes hee
could procure: And so recouering the Towne with the losse of
two of our men, there was a secret and peaceable trade admitted,
and the Spaniards came in by night, and bought of our Negroes
to the number of 200. and vpwards, and of our other merchandize
also. From thence we departed for Carthagena, where the
Gouernour was so straight, that wee could not obteine any
trafique there, and so for that our trade was neere finished, our
Generall thought it best to depart from thence the rather for the
auoyding of certaine dangerous stormes called the Huricanos,
which accustomed to begin there about that time of the yere,
and so the 24. of Iuly 1568. we departed from thence directing
our course North: and leauing the yland of Cuba vpon our
right hand, to the Eastward of vs, and so sayling toward Florida,
vpon the 12. of August an extreeme tempest arose, which dured
for the space of 8. dayes, in which our ships were most dangerously
tossed and beaten hither, and thither, so that we were in
continuall feare to be drowned by reason of the shallownes of
the coast, and in the end we were constrained to flee for succour
to the port of S. Iohn de Vllua, or Vera Cruz, situated in 19.
degrees of latitude, and in 279. degrees of longitude, which is
the port that serueth for the Citie of Mexico: in our seeking to
<!--188.png-->
<span class="pagenum">191</span>
recouer this port our Generall met by the way three small ships
that caried passengers, which hee tooke with him, and so the
sixtenth of September 1568. wee entered the saide port of S.
Iohn de Vllua. The Spaniards there supposing vs to haue bene
the King of Spaines Fleete, the chiefe officers of the Countrey
thereabouts came presently aboord our Generall, where perceiuing
themselues to haue made an vnwise aduenture, they were in
great feare to haue bene taken and stayed: howbeit our Generall
did vse them all very courteously.
<span class="sidenote">Mexico 60. leagues from S. Iuan de Vllua.</span>
In the said port there were
twelue ships which by report had in them in treasure to the
value of two hundreth thousand pound, all which being in our
Generall his power and at his deuotion, he did freely set at
libertie, as also the passengers which he had before stayed, nor
taking from any of them all the value of one groat: onely hee
stayed two men of credite and accompt, the one named Don
Laurenzo de Alua, and the other Don Pedro de Riuera, and
presently our Generall sent to the Viceroy to Mexico
which was threescore leagues off, certifying him of
our arriuall there by force of weather, desiring that
forasmuch as our Queene his Soueraigne, was the
king of Spaine his louing sister and friend, that therefore hee
would, considering our necessities and wants, furnish vs with
victuals for our Nauie, and quietly suffer vs to repaire and amend
our ships. And furthermore that at the arriual of the Spanish
Fleet which was there dayly expected and looked for, to the
ende that there might no quarell arise betweene them, and our
Generall and his company for the breach of amitie, he humbly
requested of his excellencie, that there might in this behalfe
some special order be taken. This message was sent away the
16. of September 1568. it being the very day of our arriual
there.</p>

<p>The next morning being the seuententh of the same moneth,
wee descried 13. saile of great shippes: and after that our
Generall vnderstood, that it was the king of Spaines Fleete then
looked for, he presently sent to aduertise the Generall hereof, of
our being in the sayd port, and giuing him further to vnderstand,
that before he should enter there into that harbour, it was
requisite that there should passe betweene the two Generals
some orders and conditions to bee obserued on either part, for
the better contriuing of peace betweene them and theirs, according
to our Generals request made vnto the Viceroy. And at
<!--189.png-->
<span class="pagenum">192</span>
this instant our Generall was in a great perplexitie of minde,
considering with himselfe that if hee shoulde keepe out that
Fleete from entring into the port, a thing which hee was very
well able to doe with the helpe of God, then should that Fleete
be in danger of present shipwracke and losse of all
their substance, which amounted vnto the value of
one million and eight hundreth thousand pounds.
<span class="sidenote">It is put downe 6. millions in Sir Iohn Hawkins
his relation.</span>
Againe he saw that if he suffered them to enter, hee
was assured that they would practise by all maner of
meanes to betray him and his, and on the other side the hauen
was so little, that the other Fleete entring, the shippes were to
ride one hard aboord of another. Also hee saw that if their
Fleete should perish by his keeping of them out, as of necessitie
they must if he should haue done so, then stood hee in great
feare of the Queene our Soueraignes displeasure in so waightie a
cause: therefore did he choose the least euill, which was to
suffer them to enter vnder assurance, and so to stand vpon his
guard, and to defend himselfe and his from their treasons which
we were well assured they would practise, and so the messenger
being returned from Don Martin de Henriques, the newe Viceroy,
who came in the same Fleete, and had sufficient authoritie
to command in all cases both by Sea and by lande in this
prouince of Mexico or new Spaine, did certifie our Generall,
that for the better maintenance of amitie betweene the king of
Spaine and our Soueraigne, all our requests should bee both
fauourably granted, and faithfully perfourmed: signifying further
that he heard and vnderstood of the honest and friendly dealing
of our Generall, toward the king of Spaines subjects in all places
where he had bene, as also in the said port: so that to bee briefe
our requests were articled, and set downe in writing. Viz.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">4. Articles concluded vpon, betwixt the English and
the Spaniards; although the treacherous Spaniards kept none of
them.</span>
</p>

<p>1. The first was that wee might haue victuals for
our money, and licence to sell as much wares, as
might suffice to furnish our wants.</p>

<p>2. The second, that we might be suffered peaceably
to repaire our ships.</p>

<p>3. The thirde that the yland might bee in our
possession during the time of our abode there, In
which yland our Generall for the better safetie of
him and his had alreadie planted and placed certaine
Ordinance which were eleuen pieces of brasse, therefore
he required that the same might so continue, and that no
<!--190.png-->
<span class="pagenum">193</span>
Spaniard should come to lande in the saide yland, hauing or
wearing any kinde of weapon.</p>

<p>4. The fourth and the last, that for the better and more sure
performance and maintenance of peace, and of all the conditions,
there might twelue gentlemen of credite bee deliuered of either
part as hostages.</p>

<p>These conditions were concluded and agreed vpon in writing
by the Viceroy and signed with his hand, and sealed with his
seale, and 10. hostages vpon either part were receiued. And
further it was concluded that the two Generals should meet, and
giue faith ech to other for the performance of the premisses.
Al which being done, the same was proclaimed by the
sound of a trumpet, and commandement was giuen that none
of either part should violate or breake the peace vpon paine
of death: thus at the ende of three dayes all was concluded, and
the Fleete entred the port, the ships saluting one another as the
maner of the Sea doth require: the morrow after being Friday
we laboured on all sides in placing the English ships by themselues,
the Captaines and inferiour persons of either part, offering,
and shewing great courtesie one to another, and promising great
amity vpon all sides. Howbeit as the sequel shewed, the
Spaniards meant nothing lesse vpon their parts. For the Viceroy
and gouernour thereabout had secretly at land assembled to
the number of 1000. chosen men, and wel appointed, meaning
the next Thursday being the 24. of September at dinner time to
assault vs, and set vpon vs on all sides. But before I go any
further, I thinke it not amisse briefly to discribe the matter of the
yland as it then was, and the force and strength, that it is now
of.
<span class="sidenote">A faire castle and bulwarke builded vpon the yland
of San Iuan de Vllua.</span>
For the Spaniards since the time of our Generals being
there, for the better fortifying of the same place, haue vpon the
same yland built a faire Castle and bulwarke very well
fortified: this port was then at our being there, a
little yland of stones, not past three feet aboue water
in the highest place, and not past a bow-shotte ouer
any way at the most, and it standeth from the maine
land, two bowshootes or more: and there is not in all
this coast any other place for ships safely to arriue at: also the
North windes in this coast are of great violence and force,
and vnlesse the shippes bee safely moored in, with their anckers
fastened in this yland, there is no remedie, but present destruction
and shipwracke. All this our generall wisely foreseeing,
<!--191.png-->
<span class="pagenum">194</span>
did prouide that he would haue the said yland in his custody, or
els the Spaniards might at their pleasure, haue but cut our cables,
and so with the first Northwinde that blewe, we had our
passport, for our ships had gone a shoore. But to returne to the
matter.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The value of a Spanish viceroy his faith.</span>
The time approching that their treason must be put in practise,
the same Thursday morning, some appearance thereof began to
shewe it selfe, as shifting of weapons from shippe to shippe, and
planting, and bending their Ordinance against our men that
warded vpon the lande, with great repaire of people: which
apparent shewes of breach of the Viceroyes faith caused
our Generall to sende one to the Viceroy, to enquire of him what
was meant thereby, which presently sent and gaue order, that the
Ordinance aforesayde, and other things of suspicion should bee
remooued, returning answer to our Generall in the faith of a
Viceroy, that hee would bee our defence and safetie
from all villanous treacherie: this was vpon Thursday
in the morning. Our Generall not being therewith
satisfied, seeing they had secretly conueyed a great
number of men aboord a great hulke or ship of theirs of sixe
hundreth tunne, which shippe rode hard by the Mynion, hee sent
againe to the Viceroy Robert Barret the Master of the Iesus, a
man that could speake the Spanish tongue very well, and required
that those men might bee vnshipt againe, which were in that
great hulke. The Viceroy then perceiuing that their treason was
throughly espied, stayed our Master, and sounded the Trumpet,
and gaue order that his people should vpon all sides charge vpon
our men, which warded on shoore, and else where, which strooke
such a mase, and sudden feare among vs, that many
gave place, and sought to recouer our shippes for the
safetie of themselues.
<span class="sidenote">The villanous treacherie of the Spaniards and
their crueltie.</span>
The Spaniards which secretly
were hid in ambush at lande were quickly conueyed
ouer to the yland in their long boates, and so comming
to the yland, they slewe all our men that they could meete
with, without mercy. The Minion which had somewhat before
prepared her selfe to auoyd the danger, haled away and abode
the first brunt of the 300 men that were in the great hulke: then
they sought to fall aboord the Iesus, where was a cruel fight, and
many of our men slaine: but yet our men defended themselues,
and kept them out: so the Iesus also got loose, and ioyning with
the Minion, the fight waxed hote vpon all sides: but they hauing
<!--192.png-->
<span class="pagenum">195</span>
woon and got our ordinance on shore, did greatly annoy vs. In
this fight there were two great shippes of the Spaniards sunke,
and one burnt, so that with their shippes they were not able to
harme vs, but from the shore they beat vs cruelly with our owne
ordinance, in such sort that the Iesus was very sore spoyled: and
suddenly the Spaniards hauing fired two great ships of their owne,
they came directly against vs, which bred among our men a
marueilous feare. Howbeit the Minion which had made her
sayles ready, shifted for her selfe, without consent of the Generall,
Captaine or Master, so that very hardly our Generall could be
receiued into the Minion: the most of our men that were in the
Iesus shifted for themselues, and followed the Minion in the
boat, and those which that small boat was not able to receiue,
were most cruelly slaine by the Spaniards. Of our ships none
escaped sauing the Minion and the Iudith: and all such of our
men as were not in them were inforced to abide the tyrannous
cruelty of the Spaniards.
<span class="sidenote">Copstowe one of M. Hawkins men returned from Nueua

For it is a certaine trueth, that whereas
they had taken certaine of our men ashore, they tooke and hung
them vp by the armes vpon high postes vntill the blood burst out
of their fingers ends: of which men so vsed, there is
one Copstow, and certaine others yet aliue who by
the mercifull prouidence of the almighty, were long
since arriued here at home in England, carying still

<p>After that the Viceroy, Don Martin Henriques had thus contrary
to his faith and promise most cruelly dealt with our
Generall master Hawkins, at S. Iohn de Vllua, where most of
his men were by the Spaniards slaine and drowned, and all his
ships sunke and burned, sauing the Minion, and the Iudith, which
<!--193.png-->
<span class="pagenum">196</span>
was a small barke of fiftie tunne, wherein was then Captaine
master Francis Drake aforesayd: the same night the said barke
lost vs, we being in great necessitie, and inforced to remoue with
the Minion two bow-shoote from the Spanish fleete, where we
ankered all that night: and the next morning wee weyed anker,
and recouered an island a mile from the Spaniards, where a
storme tooke vs with a North winde, in which we were greatly
distressed, hauing but two cables and two ankers left: for in the
conflict before we had lost three cables and two ankers. The
morrow after, the storme being ceased and the weather faire, we
weied, and set sayle, being many men in number, and but small
store of victuals to suffice vs for any long time: by meanes
whereof we were in despaire and feare that we should perish
through famine, so that some were in minde to yeelde themselues
to the mercy of the Spaniards, other some to the Sauages or
Infidels, and wandring thus certaine daies in these vnknowen
seas, hunger constrained vs to eate hides, cats and dogs, mice,
rats, parrats and munkies: to be short, our hunger was so great,
that wee thought it sauorie and sweete whatsoeuer wee could get
to eate.</p>

<p>And on the eight of October wee came to land againe, in the
bottome of the bay of Mexico, where we hoped to haue found
some inhabitants, that wee might haue had some reliefe of
victuals, and a place where to repaire our ship, which was so
greatly bruised, that we were scarse able with our weary armes to
keepe foorth the water: being thus oppressed with famine on the
one side and danger of drowning on the other, not knowing
where to find reliefe, wee began to bee in wonderfull despaire,
and wee were of many mindes, amongst whom there were a great
many that did desire our Generall to set them on land, making
their choise rather to submit themselues to the mercie of the
Sauages or Infidels, then longer to hazard themselues at sea,
where they very well sawe, that if they should remaine together,
if they perished not by drowning, yet hunger would inforce them
in the ende to eate one another: to which request our Generall
did very willingly agree, considering with himselfe that it was
necessary for him to lessen his number, both for the safetie of
himselfe and the rest: and thereupon being resolued to set halfe
his people ashore that he had then left aliue, it was a world to see
how suddenly mens minds were altered: for they which a little
before desired to be set on land, were now of another minde,
<!--194.png-->
<span class="pagenum">197</span>
and requested rather to stay: by meanes whereof our Generall
was inforced for the more contentation of all mens minds, and
to take away all occasions of offence, to take this order: First he
made choice of such persons of seruice and account, as were
needefull to stay, and that being done, of those which were
willing to goe he appointed such as he thought might be best
spared, and presently appointed that by the boate they should
bee set on shore, our Generall promising vs that the next yeere
he would either come himselfe, or else send to fetch vs home.
Here againe it would haue caused any stony heart to haue
relented to heare the pitifull mone that many did make, and
howe loth they were to depart: the weather was then somewhat
stormy and tempestuous, and therefore we were to passe with
great danger, yet notwithstanding there was no remedy, but we
that were appointed to goe away, must of necessitie
doe so.
<span class="sidenote">They were put on land 25 leagues northward of
Panuco the 8 of October 1568.</span>
Howbeit those that went in the first boat
were safely set on shore, but of them which went in
the second boate, of which number I my selfe was
one, the seas wrought so high, that we could not
attaine to the shore, and therefore we were constrained
through the cruell dealing of Iohn Hamptone captaine
of the Minion, and Iohn Sanders boat-swaine of the Iesus, and
Thomas Pollard his mate, to leape out of the boate into the
maine sea, hauing more then a mile to shore, and so to shift for
ourselues, and either to sinke or swimme. And of those that so
were (as it were) throwen out, and compelled to leape into the
sea, there were two drowned, which were of captaine Blands
men.</p>

<p>In the euening Of the same day, it being Munday the eight of
October, 1568, when we were all come to shore, we found fresh
water, whereof some of our men drunke so much, that they had
almost cast themselues away, for wee could scarse get life of
them for the space of two or three houres after: other some were
so cruelly swollen, what with the drinking in of the salt water,
and what with the eating of the fruit which wee found on land
hauing a stone in it much like an almond (which fruit is called
Capule) that they were all in very ill case, so that we were in a
maner all of vs both feeble, faint and weake.</p>

<p>The next morning being Tewsday, the ninth of October, we
thought, it best to trauell along by the sea coast, to seeke out
some place of habitation: (whether they were Christians or
<!--195.png-->
<span class="pagenum">198</span>
Sauages, we were indifferent, so that we might haue wherewithall
to sustaine our hungry bodies) and so departing from an hill
where we had rested all night, not hauing any drie threed about
vs, (for those that were not wet being not throwen into the sea,
were thorowly wet with raine, for all the night it rained cruelly:)
As we went from the hil, and were come into the plaine, we
were greatly troubled to passe for the grasse and weedes that
grewe there higher then any man. On the left hand we had the
sea, and vpon the right hand great woods, so that of necessitie
we must needs passe on our way Westward, through those
marshes; and going thus, suddenly we were assaulted by the
Indians, a warlike kind of people, which are in a maner as
Canibals, although they doe not feede vpon mans flesh as
Canibals doe.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Chichimici a warlike and cruell people.</span>
These people are called Chichimici, and they vse to weare
their haire long, euen down to their knees, they doe
also colour their faces greene, yellow, red and blew,
which maketh them to seeme very ougly and terrible
to beholde. These people doe keepe warres against
the Spaniards, of whom they haue bene oftentimes very cruelly
handled: for with the Spaniards there is no mercy.
<span class="sidenote">Our men assailed by the Chichemici.</span>
They perceiuing
vs at our first comming on land, supposed vs to haue
bene their enemies, the bordering Spaniards, and hauing by
their forerunners descried what number we were, and how feeble
and weake without armour or weapon, they suddenly according
to their accustomed maner, when they encounter with any
people in warlike sorte, raised a terrible and huge
crie, and so came running fiercely vpon vs, shooting
off their arrowes as thicke as haile, vnto whose
mercy we were constrained to yeeld, not hauing
amongst vs any kind of armour, nor yet weapon, sauing one
caliuer, and two old rustie swords, whereby to make any resistance,
or to saue ourselues: which when they perceiued that wee
sought not any other then fauour and mercie at their handes,
and that we were not their enemies the Spaniards, they had
compassion on vs, and came and caused vs all to sit down: and
when they had a while surueyed, and taken a perfect view of vs,
they came to all such as had any coloured clothes amongst vs,
and those they did strip starke naked, and tooke their clothes
away with them, but those that were apparelled in blacke they
did not meddle withall, and so went there wayes, and left vs
<!--196.png-->
<span class="pagenum">199</span>
without doing vs any further hurt, onely in the first
brunt they killed eight of our men.
<span class="sidenote">Eight of our men slaine.</span>
And at our
departure, they perceiuing in what weake case we
were, pointed vs with their hands which way we should go to
come to a towne of the Spaniards, which as we afterwards perceiued,
was not past ten leagues from thence, vsing these words:
Tampice, Tampice Christiano, Tampice Christiano, which is as
much (we thinke) as to say in English, at Tampice you shall find
the Christians. The weapons that they vse are no other but
bowes and arrowes, and their aime is so good, that they very
seldome misse to hit any thing that they shoote at. Shortly
after they had left vs stript (as aforesayd) we thought it best to
diuide our selues into two companies, and so being separated,
halfe of vs went vnder the leading of one Anthony Godard, who
is yet a man aliue, and dwelleth at this instant in the towne of
Plimmouth, whom before we chose to be captaine ouer vs all,
and those which went vnder his leading, of which number I
Miles Philips was one, trauailed Westward that way which the
Indians with their hands had before pointed vs to go. The
other halfe went vnder the leading of one Iohn Hooper, whom
they did choose for their captain, and with the company that
went with him, Dauid Ingram was one, and they tooke their
way and trauelled Northward, and shortly after, within the space
of two dayes, they were againe incountered with the sauage
people, and their captaine Hooper and two more of his company
were slaine: then againe they diuided themselues, and some
held on their way still Northward, and other some, knowing that
we were gone Westward, sought, to meet with vs againe, as in
truth there was about the number of 25 or 26 of them that met
with vs in the space of foure dayes againe, and then we began to
reckon amongst our selues, how many wee were that were set on
shore, and we found the number to be an hundred and foureteene,
whereof two were drowned in the sea and eight were
slaine at the first incounter, so that there remained an hundred
and foure, of which 25 went Westward with vs, and 52 to the
North with Hooper and Ingram: and as Ingram since hath
often told me, there were not past three of their company slaine,
and there were but sixe and twenty, of them that came againe to
vs, so that of the company that went Northward, there is yet
lacking, and not certainely heard of, the number of three and
twenty men. And verely I doe thinke that there are of them
<!--197.png-->
<span class="pagenum">200</span>
yet aliue, and married in the said countrey, at Cibola, as hereafter
I purpose (God willing) to discourse of more particularly,
with the reason and causes that make mee so to thinke of them
that were lacking, which were Dauid Ingram, Twide, Browne,
and sundry others, whose names wee could not remember.
And being thus met againe together, we trauelled on still Westward,
sometime thorow such thicke woods, that we were inforced
with cudgels to breake away the brambles and bushes from
tearing our naked bodies: other sometimes we should trauell
thorow the plaines, in such high grasse that we could scarse see
one another, and as we passed in some places, we should haue
of our men slaine, and fall downe suddenly, being strooken by
the Indians, which stood behinde trees and bushes, in secret
places, and so killed our men as they went by, for wee went
scatteringly in seeking of fruites to relieue our selues. We were
also oftentimes greatly annoyed with a kind of flie, which in the
Indian tongue is called Tequani, and the Spaniards called them
Muskitos. There are also in the sayd countrey a number of
other kinde of flies, but none so noysome as these Tequanies
bee: you shall hardly see them they be so small, for they are
scarse so big as a gnat: they will sucke ones blood marueilously,
and if you kill them while they are sucking, they
are so venimous that the place will swell extremely, euen as
one that is stoong with a Waspe or Bee: but if you let
them sucke their fill, and to goe away of themselues, then
they doe you no other hurt, but leaue behind them a red
spot somewhat bigger then a flea-biting. At the first wee
were terribly troubled with these kinde of flies, not knowing
their qualities, and resistance wee could make none against
them, being naked: as for cold wee feared not any, the countrey
there is alwayes so warme. And as we trauelled thus for the
space of tenne or twelue dayes, our captaine did oftentimes cause
certaine to goe vp into the toppes of high trees, to see if they
could descrie any towne or place of inhabitants, but they could
not perceiue any, and vsing often the same order to climbe vp
into high trees, at the length they descried a great riuer that fell
from the Northwest into the maine sea, and presently after, we
heard an harquebuze shot off, which did greatly incourage vs, for
thereby wee knew that we were neere to some Christians, and
did therefore hope shortly to finde some succour and comfort,
and within the space of one houre after, as we trauelled, we heard
<!--198.png-->
<span class="pagenum">201</span>
a cocke crowe, which was also no small ioy vnto vs, and so we
came to the North side of the riuer of Panuco, where the
Spaniards haue certaine Salines, at which place it was that the
harquebuze was shot off, which before we heard: to which place
we went not directly, but missing thereof, we left it about a bowshot
vpon our left hand: of this riuer wee dranke very greedily,
for wee had not met with any water in sixe dayes before, and as
we were here by the riuer side resting our selues, and longing to
come to the place where the cocke did crowe, and where the
harquebuze was shot off, we perceiued many Spaniards vpon the
other side of the riuer, riding vp and downe on horsebacke, and
they perceiuing vs, did suppose that we had beene of the Indians
their bordering enemies, the Chichimeci: the riuer was not past
halfe a bowe shoot ouer: and presently one of the Spaniards tooke
an Indian boate called a Canoa, and so came ouer, being rowed
by two Indians, and hauing taken the view of vs, did presently
rowe ouer backe againe to the Spaniards, who without any delay
made out about the number of twenty horsemen, and imbarking
themselues in the Canoas, they led their horses by the reines
swimming ouer after them, and being come ouer to that side of
the riuer where we were, they sadled their horses, and
being mounted vpon them with their lances charged, they
came very fiercely running at vs. Our captaine Anthony
Godard seeing them come in that order, did perswade vs to
submit and yeelde our selues vnto them, for being naked, as we
at this time were, and without weapon, we could not make
any resistance, whose bidding we obeied, and vpon the
yeelding of our selues, they perceiued vs to be Christians, and
did call for more Canoas, and caried vs ouer by foure and foure
in a boat, and being come on the other side, they vnderstanding
by our captaine how long we had bene without meate, imparted
between two and two a loafe of bread made out of that countrey
wheat, which the Spaniards call Maiz, of the bignesse of our
halfepenie loaues, which bread is named in the Indian tongue
Clashacally. This bread was very sweete and pleasant vnto vs,
for we had not eaten any in a long time before: and what is it
that hunger doth not make to haue a sauory and delicate taste?
And hauing thus parted the bread amongst vs, those which were
men they sent afore to the towne, hauing also many Indians
inhabitants of that place to garde them: they which were yong, as
boyes, and some such also as were feeble, they tooke vp vpon
<!--199.png-->
<span class="pagenum">202</span>
their horses, behind them, and so caried vs to the towne where
they dwelt, which was very neere distant a mile from the place
where, we came ouer.</p>

<p>This towne is well situated, and well replenished with all
kindes of fruits, as Orenges, Limons, Pomegranates, Apricoks,
and Peaches, and sundry others, and is inhabited with a great
number of tame Indians, or Mexicans, and had in it
also at that time about the number of two hundred
Spaniards, men, women, and children, besides Negros.
<span class="sidenote">The Salines of Panuco.</span>
Of their Salines, which lie upon the West side of the riuer, more
then a mile distant from thence, they make a great profit, for it is
an excellent good merchandize there: the Indians doe buy much
thereof, and cary it vp into the countrey, and there sell it to their
owne countrey people, in doubling the price. Also much of the
Salt made in this place, is transported from thence by sea to
sundry other places, as to Cuba, S. Iohn de Vllua, and the other
ports of Tamiago, and Tamachos, which are two barred hauens
West and by South aboue threescore leagues from S. Iohn de
Vllua. When we were all come to the towne, the Gouernor
there shewed himselfe very seuere vnto vs, and threatened to hang
vs all: and then he demanded what money wee had, which in
trueth was very little, for the Indians which we first met withall,
had in a maner taken all from vs, and of that which they left,
the Spaniards which brought vs ouer, tooke away a good part also:
howbeit, from Anthony Godard the Gouernour here had a chaine
of gold, which was giuen vnto him at Carthagena, by the
Gouernour there, and from others he had some small store of
money: so that we accounted that amongst vs all he had the
number of fiue hundred Pezos, besides the chaine of gold.</p>

<p>And hauing thus satisfied himselfe, when he had taken all that
we had, he caused vs to be put into a little house much like a
hogstie, where we were almost smoothered: and before we were
thus shut vp into that little coat, they gaue vs some of the
countrey wheate, called Mayz, sodden, which they feede their
hogs withall. But many of our men which had bene hurt by the
Indians at our first comming on land, whose wounds were very
sore and grieuous, desired to haue the helpe of their Surgeons to
cure their wounds. The gouernour, and most of them all
answered, that wee should haue none other Surgeon but the
hangman, which should sufficiently heale vs of all our griefes:
and thus reuiling vs, and calling vs English dogs, and Lutheran
<!--200.png-->
<span class="pagenum">203</span>
heretikes, we remained the space of three dayes in this miserable
state, not knowing what should become of vs, waiting euery houre
to be bereaued of our liues.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 4.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Wherein is shewed how we were vsed in Panuco, and in what
feare of death we were there, and how we were caried to
Mexico to the Viceroy, and of our imprisonment there
and at Tescuco, with the courtesies and cruelties wee receiued
during that time, and how in the end wee were by
proclamation giuen to serue as slaues to sundry gentlemen
Spaniards.</div>

<p>Vpon the fourth day after our comming thither, and there remaining
in a perplexitie, looking euery houre when we should
suffer death, there came a great number of Indians and Spaniards
weaponed to fetch vs out of the house, and amongst them we espied
one that brought a great many of new halters, at the sight whereof
we were greatly amazed, and made no other account but that we
should presently haue suffered death, and so crying and calling
to God for mercie and forgiuenesse of our sinnes, we prepared
our selues, making vs ready to die: yet in the end, as the sequel
shewed, their meaning was not so: for when wee were come out
of the house, with those halters they bound our armes behind vs, and
so coupling vs two and two together, they commanded vs to march
on through the towne, and so along the countrey from place to
place toward the citie of Mexico, which is distant from Panuco West
and by South the space of ninetie leagues, hauing onely but two
Spaniards, to conduct vs, they being accompanied with a great
number of Indians warding on either side with bowes and arrowes,
lest we should escape from them. And trauelling in this order,
vpon the second day at night we came vnto a towne which the
Indians call Nohele, and the Spaniards call it Santa Maria: in
which towne there is a house of white friers, which did very
courteously vse vs, and gaue vs hote meat, as mutton and broath,
and garments also to couer our selues withal, made of white
bayes: we fed very greedily of the meat, and of the Indian fruit,
called Nochole, which fruit is long and small, much like in
fashion to a little cucumber. Our greedy feeding caused vs to
fall sicke of hote burning agues. And here at this place one
<!--201.png-->
<span class="pagenum">204</span>
Thomas Baker one of our men died of a hurt: for he had bene
before shot with an arrow into the throat at the first incounter.</p>

<p>The next morrow about ten of the clocke, we departed from
thence, bound two and two together, and garded as before, and
so trauailed on our way toward Mexico, till we came to a towne
within forty leagues of Mexico, named Mestitlan, where is a
house of blacke friers: and in this towne there are about the
number of three hundred Spaniards, both men, women, and
children. The friers sent vs meat from the house ready dressed,
and the friers, and the men and women vsed vs very courteously,
and gave vs some shirts and other such things as we lacked.
Here our men were very sicke of their agues, and with eating of
another fruit called in the Indian tongue, Guiaccos, which fruit
did binde vs so sore, that for the space of tenne or
twelue dayes we could not ease our selues. The next
morning we departed from thence with our two Spaniards
and Indian gard, as aforesayd. Of these two Spaniards the
one was an aged man, who all the way did very courteously intreate
vs, and would carefully go before to prouide for vs both
meat and things, necessary to the vttermost of his power: the
other was a yong man who all the way trauelled with vs, and
neuer departed from vs, who was a very cruell caitiue, and he
caried a iaueline in his hand, and sometimes when as our men
with very feeblenesse and faintnesse were not able to goe so fast
as he required them, he would take his iauelin in both his handes,
and strike them with the same betweene the necke and the
shoulders so violently, that he would strike them downe; then
would he cry, and say, Marchad, marchad Ingleses perros, Luterianos,
enemigos de Dios: which is as much to say in English, as
March, march on you English dogges, Lutherans, enemies to God.
And the next day we came to a towne called Pachuca, and there
are two places of that name: as this towne of Pachuca, and the
mines of Pachuca, which are mines of siluer, and are about sixe
leagues distant from this towne of Pachuca towards the Northwest.</p>

<p>Here at this towne the good olde man our Gouernour suffered
vs to stay two dayes and two nights, hauing compassion of our
sicke and weake men, full sore against the minde of the yoong
man his companion. From thence we tooke our iourney, and
trauelled foure or fiue dayes by little villages, and Stantias, which
are farmes or dairie houses of the Spaniards, and euer as wee had
<!--202.png-->
<span class="pagenum">205</span>
neede, the good olde man would still prouide vs sufficient of
meates, fruites, and water to sustaine vs. At the end of which
fiue dayes wee came to a towne within fiue leagues of Mexico,
which is called Quoghliclan, were wee also stayed one whole
day and two nights, where was a faire house of gray friers, howbeit
wee saw none of them. Here wee were told by the
Spaniards in the towne, that wee had not past fifteene English
miles from thence to Mexico, whereof wee were all very ioyfull
and glad, hoping that when we came thither, we should either be
relieued, and set free out of bonds, or els bee quickly dispatched
out of our liues: for seeing our selues thus caried bound from
place to place, although some vsed vs courteously, yet could wee
neuer ioy, nor be merrie till wee might perceiue our selues set
free from that bondage, either by death or otherwise.</p>

<p>The next morning we departed from thence on our iourney
towards Mexico, and so trauelled till wee came within two leagues
of it, where there was built by the Spaniards a very faire church,
called our Ladyes church, in which there is an image of our Lady
of siluer and gilt, being as high, and as large as a tall woman, in
which church, and before this image, there are as many lamps of
siluer as there be dayes in the yeere, which vpon high dayes are
all lighted. Whensoeuer any Spaniards passe by this church,
although they be on horse backe, they will alight, and come into
the church, and kneele before this image, and pray to our Lady
to defend them from all euil; so that whether he be horseman
or footman he will not passe by, but first goe into the Church,
and pray as aforesayd, which if they doe not they thinke and
beleeue that they shall neuer prosper: which image they call in
the Spanish tongue, Nuestra sennora de Guadalupe. At this
place there are certain cold baths, which arise, springing vp as
though the water did seeth: the water thereof is somewhat
brackish in taste, but very good for any that have any sore or
wound, to wash themselues therewith, for as they say, it healeth
many: and euery yeere once vpon our Lady day the people vse
to repair thither to offer, and to pray in that Church before the
image, and they say that our Lady of Guadalupe doeth work a
number of miracles. About this Church there is not any towne
of Spaniards that is inhabited, but certaine Indians doe dwell
there in houses of their own countrey building.</p>

<p>Here we were met with a great number of Spaniards on horsebacke,
which came from Mexico to see vs, both gentlemen, and
<!--203.png-->
<span class="pagenum">206</span>
men of occupations, and they came as people to see a wonder:
we were still called vpon to march on: and so about foure of the
clocke in the afternoone of the said day we entered into the
citie of Mexico, by the way or street called la calle Santa Catherina:
and we stayed not in any place till we came to the house
or palace of the Vice Roy, Don Martin Henriques, which
standeth in the middest of the city, hard by the market place,
called La pla&ccedil;a del Marquese.
<span class="sidenote">Certaine Englishmen taken prisoners at the fight
at Sant Iuan de Vllua.</span>
We had not stayed any long
time at this place, but there was brought vs by the Spaniards
from the market place great store of meat, sufficient to haue satisfied
fiue times so many as we were: some also gaue vs hats,
and some gaue vs money: in which place we stayed for the space
of two houres, and from thence we were conueyed by water in
two large Canoas to an hospital where as certaine of
our men were lodged, which were taken before the
fight at S. Iohn de Vllua: wee should haue gone to
our Ladies hospitall, but that there were also so many
of our men taken before at that fight that there was
no roome for vs. After our coming thither, many of
the company that came with me from Panuco dyed within the space
of fourteene dayes: soone after which time we were taken foorth
from that place, and put altogether into our Ladies hospitall, in
which place we were courteously vsed, and visited oftentimes by
vertuous gentlemen and gentlewomen of the citie, who brought
vs diuers things to comfort vs withall, as succats and marmilads,
and such other things, and would also many times giue vs many
things, and that very liberally. In which hospitall we remained
for the space of sixe moneths, vntill we were all whole
and sound of body, and then we were appointed by the Vice
Roy to be caried vnto the towne of Tescuco, which is from
Mexico Southwest distant eight leagues:<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in which towne there
are certaine houses of correction and punishment for ill people
called Obraches, like to Bridewell here in London: into which
place diuers Indians are sold for slaues, some for ten yeeres, and
some for twelue. It was no small griefe vnto vs when we
vnderstood that we should be caried thither, and to bee vsed as
slaues, we had rather be put to death: howbeit there was no
remedy, but we were caried to the prison of Tescuco, where we
were not put to any labour, but were very straitly kept, and
<!--204.png-->
<span class="pagenum">207</span>
almost famished, yet by the good prouidence of our mercifull
God, we happened there to meet with one Robert Sweeting, who
was the sonne of an Englishman, borne of a Spanish woman;
this man could speake very good English, and by his means wee
were holpen very much with victuals from the Indians, as mutton,
hennes, and bread. And if we had not bene so relieued, we had
surely perished: and yet all the prouision that wee had gotten
that way was but slender. And continuing thus straightly kept
in prison there for the space of two moneths, at the length wee
agreed amongst our selues to breake forth of prison, come of it
what would, for we were minded rather to suffer death then
longer to liue in that miserable state. And so hauing escaped
out of prison, we knew not what way to flie for the safetie of ourselues,
the night was darke, and it rained terribly, and not hauing
any guide, we went we knew not whither, and in the morning,
at the appearing of the day, we perceiued our selues to be come
hard to the city of Mexico, which is 24 English miles from
Tescuco. The day being come we were espied by the Spaniards,
and pursued, and taken, and brought before the Vice Roy and
head iustices, who threatned to hang vs for breaking of the kings
prison.
<span class="sidenote">Almost an hundred Englishmen prisoners in
Mexico.</span>
Yet in the end they sent vs into a garden belonging to
the Vice Roy, and comming thither, we found there our English
gentlemen which were deliuered as hostages when as our General
was betrayed at S. Iohn de Vllua, as is aforesaid, and with them
wee also found Robert Barret, the Master of the Iesus, in which
place we remained labouring and doing such things as we were
commanded, for the space of 4 moneths, hauing but
two sheepe a day allowed to suffice vs all, being very
neere a hundred men, and for bread we had euery
man two loaues a day, of the quantity of one halfe-peny
loafe. At the end of which foure moneths,
they hauing remooued our gentlemen hostages, and the Master
of the Iesus to a prison in the Vice Roy his own house, did
cause it to be proclaimed, that what gentleman Spaniard soeuer
was willing or would haue any English man to serue him, and
be bound to keepe him forth comming, to appeare before the
Iustices within one moneth after notice giuen, that they should
repaire to the said garden, and there take their choice: which
proclamation was no sooner made, but the gentlemen came and
repaired to the garden amaine, so that happie was he that could
soonest get one of vs.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 5.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Wherein is shewed in what good sort, and how wealthily we
liued with our masters vntil the comming of the Inquisition,
when as againe our sorrows began a fresh: Of our
imprisonment in the holy house, and of the seuere
iudgement, and sentences giuen against vs, and with what
rigour and crueltie the same were executed.</div>

<p>The gentlemen that thus tooke vs for their seruants or
slaues, did new apparell vs through out, with whom we abode,
doing such service as they appointed vs vnto, which was for the
most part to attend vpon them at the table, and to be as their
chamberlaines, and to waite vpon them when they went abroad,
which they greatly accounted of; for in that countrey no Spaniard
will serue one another, but they are all of them attended and
serued by Indians weekly, and by Negroes which be their slaues
during their life. In this sort we remained and serued in the
said citie of Mexico, and thereabouts for the space of a yeere
and somewhat longer. Afterwards many of vs were by our
masters appointed to go to sundry of their Mines where they had
to doe, and to be as ouerseers of the Negroes and Indians that
laboured there. In which mines many of vs did profite and
gaine greatly: for first we were allowed three hundred Pezos a
man for a yeere, which is threescore pound sterling and besides
that the Indians and Negroes which wrought vnder our charge,
vpon our well using and intreating of them, would at times as
vpon Saturdayes when they had left worke, labour for vs, and
blow as much siluer as should be worth vnto vs 3 markes or there
abouts, euery marke being worth 6 Pezos, and a halfe of their
money, which 19 Pezos and a halfe, is worth 4li. 10s. of our
money. Sundry weeks we did gaine so much by this means besides
our wages, that many of vs became very rich, and were
worth three thousand, or foure thousand Pezos, for we liued and
gained thus in those Mines some three or foure yeeres. As concerning
those Gentlemen which were deliverd as hostages, and
that were kept in prison, in the Viceroy his house, after that we
were gone from out the garden to serue sundry gentlemen as
aforesaid, they remained prisoners in the said house for the space
of 4 moneths after their comming thither, at the end whereof the
fleete being readie to depart from S. Iohn de Vllua, to goe for Spaine,
<!--206.png-->
<span class="pagenum">209</span>
the said Gentlemen were sent away into Spaine with the fleete,
where as I haue heard it credibly reported, many of them died
with the cruell handling of the Spaniards in the Inquisition
house, as those which haue bene deliuered home after they had
suffered the persecution of that house can more perfectly declare.
Robert Barret also master of the Iesus, was sent away with the
fleete into Spaine the next yeere following, where afterwards he
suffered persecution in the Inquisition, and at the last was condemned
to be burnt, and with him one more of our men whose
name was Iohn Gilbert.</p>

<p>Now after that sixe yeeres were fully expired since our first
coming into the Indies, in which time we had bene imprisoned
and serued in the said countreys as is before truely declared. In
the yeere of our Lord one thousand fiue hundred seuenty foure,
the Inquisition began to be established in the Indies, very much
against the mindes of many of the Spaniards themselues: for
neuer vntil this time since their first conquering and planting in
the Indies, were they subiect to that bloodie and cruell Inquisition.
The chiefe Inquisitor was named Don Pedro Moya de
Contreres, and Iohn de Bouilla his companion, and Iohn
Sanches the Fischall, and Pedro de los Rios the Secretary: they
being come and setled, and placed in a very faire house neere
vnto the white Friers, considering with themselues that they must
make an entrance and beginning of that their most detestable
Inquisition here in Mexico, to the terror of the whole countrey,
thought it best to call vs that were Englishmen first in question,
and so much the rather, for that they had perfect knowledge and
intelligence that many of vs were become very rich, as hath bene
alreadie declared, and therefore we were a very good booty and
pray to the Inquisitors: so that now againe began our sorrowes
a fresh, for we were sent for, and sought out in all places of the
countrey, and proclamation made vpon paine of losing of goods
and excommunication that no man should hide or keepe secret
any Englishmen or any part of their goods. By means whereof
we were all soone apprehended in all places, and all our goods
seized and taken for the Inquisitors vse, and so from all parts of
the countrey we were conueied and sent as prisoners to the citie
of Mexico, and there committed to prison, in sundry darke dungeons,
where we could not see but by candle light, and were
neuer past two together in one place, so that we saw not one
another, neither could one of vs tell what was become of another.
<!--207.png--><span class="pagenum">210</span>
Thus we remained close imprisoned for the space of a yeere and
a halfe, and others for some lesse time, for they came to prison
euer as they were apprehended. During which time of our imprisonment,
at the first beginning we were often called before the
Inquisitors alone, and there seuerely examined of our faith, and
commanded to say the Pater noster, the Aue Maria, and the
Creed in Latin, which God knoweth great number of vs could
not say, otherwise then in the English tongue. And hauing the
said Robert Sweeting who was our friend at Tescuco alwayes
present with them for an interpreter, he made report for vs, that in
our own countrey speech we could say them perfectly, although
not word for word as they were in Latin. Then did they proceede
to demand of vs vpon our othes what wee did beleeue of
the Sacrament, and whether there did remaine any bread or wine
after the words of consecration, yea or no, and whether we did
not beleeue that the host of bread which the priest did hold vp
ouer his head, and the wine that was in the chalice, was the very
true and perfect body and blood of our Sauiour Christ, yea or
no: To which if we answered not yea, then was there no way but
death. Then they would demand of vs what we did remember
of our selues, what opinions we had held, or had bin taught to
hold contrary to the same whiles we were in England: to which
we for the safety of our liues were constrained to say, that we
neuer did beleeue, nor had bene taught otherwise then as before
we had sayd. Then would they charge vs, that we did not tell
them the truth, that they knew the contrary, and therefore we
should cal our selues to remembrance, and make them a better
answer at the next time, or els we should be rackt, and made to
confesse the trueth whether we would or no. And so comming
againe before them the next time, we were still demanded of our
beliefe whiles we were in England, and how we had bin taught,
and also what we thought or did know of such of our owne company
as they did name vnto vs, so that we could neuer be free
from such demands, and at other times they would promise vs,
that if we would tell them trueth, then should we haue
fauour and be set at libertie, although we very wel knew
their fair speeches were but means to entrap vs, to the hazard
and losse of our liues: howbeit God so mercifully wrought for vs
by a secret means that we had, that we kept vs still to our first
answer, and would stil say that we had told the trueth vnto them,
and knew no more by our selues nor any other of our fellows
<!--208.png-->
<span class="pagenum">211</span>
then as we had declared, and that for our sinnes and offences in
England against God and our Lady, or any of his blessed Saints,
we were heartily sory for the same, and did cry God mercy, and
besought the Inquisitors for Gods sake, considering what we came
into those countreyes by force of weather, and against our wils,
and that neuer in all our lives we had either spoken or done any
thing contrary to their lawes, that therefore they would haue
mercy vpon vs.
<span class="sidenote">Our men are cruelly rackt.</span>
Yet all this would not serue; for still from time
to time we were called upon to confesse and about
the space of 3 moneths before they proceeded to their
seuere iudgement, we were al rackt, and some enforced
to vtter that against themselves, which afterwards cost them
their liues. And thus hauing gotten from our own mouthes
matter sufficient for them to proceed in iudgement against vs,
they caused a large scaffold to be made in the middest of the
market place in Mexico right ouer against the head church, and
14 or 15 daies before the day of their iudgement with the sound
of a trumpet, and the noise of their Attahalies, which are a kind
of drummes, they did assemble the people in all parts of the
citie: before whom it was then solemnely proclaimed that whosoeuer
would vpon such a day repaire to the market place, they
should heare the sentence of the holy Inquisition against the
English heretikes, Lutherans, and also see the same put in
execution. Which being done, and the time approching of this
cruell judgement, the night before they came to the prison where
we were, with certaine officers of that holy hellish house, bringing
with them certaine fooles coats which they had prepared for vs,
being called in their language S. Benitos, which coats were made,
of yellow cotton and red crosses vpon them, both before and behind:
they were so busied in putting on their coats about vs, and
bringing vs out into a large yard, and placing and pointing vs in
what order we should go to the scaffold or place of iudgment
vpon the morrow, that they did not once suffer vs to sleepe all that
night long. The next morning being come, there was giuen to every
one of vs for our breakfast a cup of wine, and a slice of bread fried in
honie, and so about eight of the clocke in the morning, we set
foorth of the prison, euery man alone in his yellow coat, and a
rope about his necke, and a great greene Waxe candle in his
hand vnlighted, hauing a Spaniard appointed to goe vpon either
side of euery one of vs: and so marching in this order and
maner toward the scaffold in the market place, which was a bow
<!--209.png-->
<span class="pagenum">212</span>
shoot distant or thereabouts, we found a great assembly of people
all the way, and such a throng, that certain of the Inquisitors
officers on horseback were constrained to make way, and so
comming to the scaffold, we went vp by a pairs of stayres, and
found seates readie made and prepared for vs to sit downe on,
euery man in order as he should be called to receiue his iudgement.
We being thus set downe as we were appointed, presently
the Inquisitors came vp another paire of staires, and the Viceroy
and all the chiefe Iustices with them. When they were set
downe and placed vnder the cloth of estate agreeing to their
degrees and calling; then came vp also a great number of Friers,
white, blacke and gray, about the number of 300 persons, they
being set in the places for them appointed. Then was there a
solemne Oyes made, and silence commanded, and then presently
beganne their seuere and cruell iudgement.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The cruell iudgements of the Spanish Inquisitors
vpon our poore countrey-men.</span>
The first man that was called was one Roger the chiefe
Armourer of the Iesus, and hee had iudgement to
haue three hundred stripes on horsebacke, and after
condemned to the gallies as a slaue for 10 yeeres.</p>

<p>After him were called Iohn Gray, Iohn Brown,
Iohn Moone, Iames Collier, and one Thomas Browne:
these were adiudged to haue 200 stripes on horsebacke,
and after to be committed to the gallies for
the space of 8 yeeres.</p>

<p>Then was called Iohn Keyes, and was adiudged to have 100
stripes on horsebacke, and condemned to serue in the gallies for
the space of 6 yeeres.</p>

<p>Then were seuerally called the number of 53 one after an
other, and euery man had his seueral iudgement, some to haue
200 stripes on horseback, and some 100, and condemned for
slaues to the gallies, some for 6 yeeres, some for 8 and some
for 10.</p>

<p>And then was I, Miles Philips, called, and was adiudged to
serue in a monasterie for 5 yeeres, without any stripes, and to
weare a fooles coat, or S. Benito, during all that time.</p>

<p>Then were called Iohn Storie, Richard Williams, Dauid
Alexander, Robert Cooke, Paul Horsewell and Thomas Hull:
these sixe were condemned to serue in monasteries without
stripes, some for three yeeres and some for foure, and to weare
the S. Benito during all the said time. Which being done, and
it now drawing toward night, George Riuelly, Peter Momfrie, and
<!--210.png-->
<span class="pagenum">213</span>
Cornelius the Irishman, were called and had their iudgement to
be burnt to ashes, and so were presently sent away to the place,
of execution in the market place but a little from the scaffold,
where they were quickly burnt and consumed. And as for vs
that had receiued our iudgement, being 68 in number, we were
caried backe that night to prison againe. And the next day in
the morning being good Friday, the yeere of our Lord 1575; we
were all brought into a court, of the Inquisitors pallace, where we
found a horse in a readinesse for euery one of our men which
were condemned to haue stripes, and to be committed to the
gallies, which were in number 60 and so they being inforced to
mount vp on horsebacke naked from the middle vpward, were
caried to be shewed as a spectacle for all the people to behold
throughout the chiefe and principall streetes of the citie, and had
the number of stripes to euery one of them appointed, most
cruelly laid vpon their naked bodies with long whips by sundry
men appointed to be the executioners thereof: and before our
men there went a couple of criers which cried as they went:
Behold these English dogs, Lutherans, enemies to God, and all
the way as they went there were some of the Inquisitors themselues,
and of the familiars of that rakehel order, that cried to
the executioners, Strike, lay on those English hereticks, Lutherans,
Gods enemies: and so this horrible spectacle being shewed
round about the citie, they returned to the Inquisitors house
with their backes all gore blood, and swollen with great bumps,
and were then taken from their horses, and carried againe to
prison, where they remained vntill they were sent into Spaine to
the gallies, there to receiue the rest of their martirdome: and I
and the 6 other with me which had iudgement, and were condemned
amongst the rest to serue an apprentiship in the
monastery, were taken presently and sent to certaine religious
houses appointed for the purpose.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 6.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Wherein is shewed how we were vsed in the religious houses, and
that when the time was expired, that we were adiudged
to serue in them, there came newes to Mexico of M.
Francis Drakes being in the South Sea, and what preparation
was made to take him, and how I seeking to escape,
was againe taken, and put in prison at Vera Cruz, and
how againe I made mine escape from thence.</div>

<p>I Miles Philips and William Lowe were appointed to the
<!--211.png-->
<span class="pagenum">214</span>
blacke Friers, where I was appointed to be an ouerseer of Indian
workmen, who wrought there in building of a new church:
amongst which Indians I learned their language of Mexican
tongue very perfectly, and had great familiaritie with many of
them, whom I found to be a courteous and louing kind of people,
ingenious, and of great vnderstanding, and they hate and abhorre
the Spaniards with all their hearts, they haue vsed such horrible
cruelties against them, and do still keepe them in such subiection
and seruitude, that they and the Negros also doe daily lie in
waite to practise their deliuerance out of that thraldome and
bondage, that the Spaniards doe keepe them in. William Lowe
he was appointed to serue the Cooke in the kitchen, Richard
Williams and Dauid Alexander were appointed to the Grey
Friers, Iohn Story and Robert Cooke to the white Friers: Paul
Horsewel the Secretary tooke to be his seruant: Thomas Hull
was sent to a Monastery of priests, where afterward he died.
Thus we serued out the yeeres that we were condemned for,
with the vse of our fooles coates, and we must needs confesse
that the Friers did vse very courteously: for euery one of vs had
his chamber with bedding and diet, and all things cleane and
neat: yea many of the Spaniards and Friers themselues do vtterly
abhorre and mislike of that cruell Inquisition, and would as they
durst bewaile our miseries, and comfort vs the best they could,
although they stood in such feare of that diuelish Inquisition, that
they durst not let the left hande know what the right doth. Now
after that the time was expired for which we were condemned
to serue in those religious houses, we were then brought againe
before the chief Inquisitor, and had all our fooles coates pulled
off and hanged vp in the head church, called Ecclesia Maior,
and euery mans name and iudement written thereupon with this
addition, An heretike Lutheran reconciled. And there are also
all their coates hanged vp, which were condemned to the gallies,
with their names and iudgements, and vnderneath his coat,
Heretike Lutheran reconciled. And also the coats and names
of the three that were burned, whereupon were written, An
obstinate heretike Lutheran burnt. Then were we suffered to goe
vp and downe the countrey, and to place our selues as we could,
and yet not so free, but that we very well knew that there was
good espiall alwayes attending vs and all our actions, so that we
durst not once speake or looke awry. Dauid Alexander and
Robert Cooke returned to serue the Inquisitor, who shortly after
<!--212.png-->
<span class="pagenum">215</span>
maried them both to two of his Negro women: Richard Williams
maried a rich widow of Biskay with 4000 Pezos. Paul Horsewell
is maried to a Mestisa, as they name those whose fathers were
Spaniards, and their mothers Indians, and this woman which Paul
Horsewell hath maried, is sayd to be the daughter of one that came
in with Hernando Cortes the conquerour, who had with her in
mariage foure thousand Pezos, and a faire house: Iohn Storie is
maried to a Negro woman: William Lowe had leaue and licence
to goe into Spaine where he is now maried: for mine owne part
I could neuer throughly settle my selfe to marry in that countrey,
although many faire offers were made vnto me of such as were of
great abilitie and wealth, but I could haue no liking to liue in
that place, where I must euery where see and know such horrible
idolatrie committed, and durst not once for my life speake
against it: and therefore I had alwayes a longing and
desire to this my natiue countrey: and, to returne and
serue againe in the Mines where I might haue gathered
great riches and wealth, I very well saw that at one time
or another I should fall againe into the danger of that diuelish
Inquisition, and so be strip of all, with losse of life also, and
therefore I made my choice rather to learne to weaue Grogranes
and Taffaties, and so compounding with a Silke-weauer, I bound
my selfe for three yeeres to serue him, and gaue him an hundred
and fiftie Pezos to teach me the science, otherwise he would not
haue taught mee vnder seuen yeeres prentiship, and by this
meanes I liued the more quiet, and free from suspition. Howbeit
I should many times be charged by familiars of that diuelish
house, that I had a meaning to runne away into England, and to
be an heretike Lutheran againe: To whom I would answere
that they had no neede to suspect any such thing in mee, for
that they knew all very well that it was impossible for me to
escape by any maner of meanes: yet notwithstanding I was called
before the Inquisitor, and demanded why I did not marrie: I
answered that I had bound myselfe at an occupation. Well said
the Inquisitor, I knowe thou meanest to runne away, and therefore
I charge thee here vpon paine of burning as an heretike
relapsed, that thou depart not out of this citie, nor come neere
to the port of S. Iohn de Vllua, nor to any other port: To the
which I answered that I would willingly obey. Yea said he,
see thou doe so, and thy fellowes also, they shall haue the like
charge.</p>

<p><!--213.png--><span class="pagenum">216</span></p>

<p>So I remained at my science the full time, and learned the
Art, at the end wherof there came newes to Mexico that there
were certaine Englishmen landed with a great power at the port
of Acapulco, vpon the South sea, and that they were comming
to Mexico to take the spoyle thereof, which wrought a marueilous
great feare amongst them, and many of those that were rich
began to shift for themselues, their wiues and children: vpon
which hurlie burlie the Viceroy caused a generall muster to be
made of all the Spaniards in Mexico, and there were found to
be the number of 7000 and odde householders of Spaniards in
the citie and suburbs, and of single men vnmaried, the number
of 3000 and of Mestizoes, which are counted to be the sonnes of
Spaniards, borne of Indian women, twenty thousand persons,
and then was Paul Horsewel and I Miles Philips sent for before
the Viceroy, and were examined if we did know an English man
named Francis Drake, which was brother to Captaine Hawkins:
to which we answered, that Captaine Hawkins had not any
brother but one, which was a man of the age of threescore yeeres
or thereabouts, and was now gouernour of Plimmouth in England.
And then he demanded of vs if we knewe one Francis Drake,
and we answered, no.</p>

<p>While these things were in doing, there came newes that all
the Englishmen were gone, yet were there eight hundred men
made out vnder the leading of seueral Captains, whereof two
hundred were sent to the port of S. Iohn de Vllua, vpon the
North Sea vnder the conduct of Don Luys Suares, two hundred
were sent to Guatimala in the South sea, who had for their
captaine Iohn Cortes, two hundred more were sent to Guatulco,
a port of the South sea, ouer whom went for captaine Don Pedro
de Robles, and two hundred more were sent to Acapulco, the
port where it was said that Captaine Drake had bene. And they
had for Captaine doctor Robles Alcalde de Corte, with whom I
Miles Philips went as interpreter, hauing licence giuen by the
Inquisitors. When we were come to Acapulco, we found that
Captaine Drake was departed from thence, more then a moneth
before we came thither. But yet our captaine Alcalde de Corte
there presently embarked himselfe in a small ship of threescore
tunne or thereabout, hauing also in companie with him two
other small barkes, and not past two hundred men in all, with
whom I went as interpreter in his owne ship, which God knoweth
was but weake and ill appointed, so that for certaine, if we had
<!--214.png-->
<span class="pagenum">217</span>
met with Captaine Drake, he might easily haue taken vs all:
We being imbarked kept our course and ranne Southward
towards Panama, keeping still as nigh the shore as we could, and
leauing the land vpon our left hand, and hauing coasted thus
for the space of eighteene or twentie dayes, and being more to
the South then Guatimala, we met at last with other ships which
came from Panama, of whom we were certainly informed that
he was cleane gone off the coast more then a moneth before:
and so we returned backe to Acapulco againe, and there landed,
our Captaine being thereunto forced, because his men were very
sore sea-sicke: All the while that I was at Sea with them I was
a glad man, for I hoped that if we met with master Drake, we
should all be taken, so that then I should haue beene freed out
of that danger and miserie wherein I liued, and should returne
to mine owne countrey of England againe. But missing thereof,
when I sawe there was no remedie but that we must needes
come on lande againe, little doeth any man know the sorow and
griefe that inwardly I felt, although outwardly I was constrained
to make faire weather of it. And so being landed, the next morow
after, we began our iourney towardes Mexico, and past these
townes of name in our way, as first the towne of Tuatepec, 50
leagues from Mexico, from thence to Washaca, 40 leagues from
Mexico: from thence to Tepiaca 24 leagues from Mexico, and
from thence to Pueblo de los Angeles, where is a high hill which
casteth out fire three times a day, which hill is 18 leagues in
maner directly West from Mexico, from thence we went to
Stapelapa, 8 leagues from Mexico, and there our captaine and
most of his men tooke boat, and came to Mexico againe, hauing
bene forth about the space of seuen weekes or thereabouts.
Our captaine made report to the Viceroy what he had done, and
how farre he had trauelled, and that for certaine he was informed
that Captaine Drake was not to be heard of.
<span class="sidenote">The Spanish Viceroy prophecied, but
falsely.</span>
To
which the Viceroy replied and said, Surely we shall
haue him shortly come into our hands driuen a land
through necessitie in some one place or other, for he
being now in these seas of Sur, it is not possible for him to get
out of them againe, so that if he perish not at sea, yet hunger
wil force him to land. And then againe I was commanded by
the Viceroy that I should not depart the citie of Mexico, but
alwaies be at my masters house in a readinesse at an houres
warning, when soeuer I should be called: for that notwithstanding
<!--215.png-->
<span class="pagenum">218</span>
within one moneth after certaine Spaniards going to Mecameca,
18 leagues from Mexico, to send away certaine hides and
Cochinilla, that they had there at their Stantias or dairie houses,
and my master hauing leaue of the Secretarie for me to go with
them, I tooke my iourney with them being very well horsed and
appointed, and comming thither and passing the time there at
Mecameca certaine dayes till we had perfect intelligence that the
fleete was readie to depart, I not being past 3 daies iourney
from the port of S. John de Vllua, thought it to be the meetest
time for me to make an escape, and I was the bolder, presuming
vpon my Spanish tongue, which I spake as naturally as any of
them all, thinking with my selfe, that when I came to S. Iohn de
Vllua, I would get to be entertained as a souldiour, and so go
home into Spaine in the same Fleete, and therefore secretly one
euening late, the moone shining faire, I conueyed my selfe away,
and riding so for the space of two nights and two dayes, sometimes
in, and sometimes out, resting very little all that time, vpon
the second day at night I came to the towne of Vera Cruz,
distant from the port of S. Iohn de Vllua, where the ships rode,
but only 5 leagues, and here purposing to rest my selfe a day or
two, I was no sooner alighted, but within the space of one halfe
houre after, I was by ill hap arrested, and brought before Iustices
there, being taken and suspected to be a gentlemans sonne of
Mexico, that was runne away from his father, who in trueth was
the man they sought for: So I being arrested, and brought before
the Iustices, there was a great hurly burly about the matter, euery
man charging me that I was the sonne of such a man dwelling
in Mexico, which I flatly denied, affirming that I knewe not the
man, yet would they not beleeue me, but vrged stil vpon me
that I was he that they sought for, and so I was conueied away
to prison. And as I was thus going to prison, to the further
increase of my griefe, it chanced that at that very instant there
was a poore man in the presse that was come to towne to sell
hennes, who told the Iustices that they did me wrong, and that
in truth he knew very well that I was an Englishman and no
Spaniard. They then demanded of him how he knew that, and
threatned him that he said so, for that he was my companion,
and sought to conuey me away from my father, so that he also
was threatned to be laid in prison with me: he for the discharge
of himselfe stood stifly in it, that I was an Englishman, and one
of captaine Hawkins men, and that he had knowen me weare

<span class="pagenum">219</span>
the S. Benito in the Blacke-friers at Mexico, for 3 or 4 whole
yeres together: which when they heard, they forsooke him, and
began to examine me a new, whether that speech of his were
true, yea or no, which when they perceiued that I could not
denie, and perceiuing that I was run from Mexico, and came
thither of purpose to conuey my selfe away with the fleete, I
was presently committed to prison with a sorrowfull heart, often
wishing my selfe that that man which knew me had at that
time bene further off: howbeit he in sinceritie had compassion
of my distressed estate, thinking by his speech, and knowing of
me, to haue set me free from that present danger which he sawe
me in: howbeit, contrary to his expectation, I was thereby brought
into my extreme danger, and to the hazard of my life, yet there
was no remedy but patience perforce. And I was no sooner
brought into prison, but I had a great paire of bolts clapt on my
legs, and thus I remained in that prison for the space of 3 weekes
where were also many other prisoners which were thither committed
for sundry crimes and condemned to the gallies. During
which time of imprisonment there, I found amongst those my
prison-fellowes some that had knowen me before in Mexico, and
truely they had compassion of me, and would spare of their
victuals and any thing els that they had to doe me good: amongst
whom there was one of them that told me that he vnderstood by
a secret friend of his which often came to the prison to him, that
I should be shortly sent backe againe to Mexico by wagon, so
soone as the fleete was gone from S. Iohn de Vllua, for Spaine.
This poore man my prison fellow of himselfe, and without any
request made by me, caused his said friend which came often
vnto him to the grate of the prison, to bring him wine and
victuals, to buy for him 2 kniues which had files in their backes,
which files were so wel made that they would serue and suffice
any prisoner to file off his irons, and of those kniues or files he
brought one to me, and told me that he had caused it to be made
for me, and let me haue it at that very price it cost him, which
was 2 Pezos, the value of 8.s. of our money: which knife when I
had it, I was a ioyfull man, and conueied the same into the foote
of my boot, vpon the inside of my left leg, and so within 3 or 4
dayes after that I had thus receiued my knife, I was suddenly
called for, and brought before the head Iustice which caused
those my irons with the round bolt to be stricken off and sent to
a Smiths in the towne, where was a new paire of bolts made
<!--217.png-->
<span class="pagenum">220</span>
ready for me of another fashion, which had a broad iron barre
comming betweene the shackles, and caused my hands to be
made fast with a paire of manacles; and so was I presently laid
in a wagon all alone, which was there readie to depart with sundry
other wagons, to the number of 60. towardes Mexico, and they
all were laden with sundry merchandise which came in the fleete
out of Spaine.</p>

<p>The wagon that I was in was foremost in all the companie, and
as we trauelled I being alone in the wagon, began to trie if I
could plucke my hands out of the manacles, and as God would,
although it were somewhat painefull for me, yet my hands were so
slender that I could pull them out, and put them in againe, and
euer as we went, when the wagon made most noyse, and the men
were busiest, I would be working to file off my bolts, and traueling
thus for the space of 8 leagues from Vera Cruz, we came to
an high hill, at the entring vp of which (as God would) one of the
wheeles of the waggon wherein I was, brake, so that by that
means the other wagons went afore, and the wagon man that had
charge of me set an Indian Carpenter a worke to mend the
wheele: and here at this place they baited at an hostrie that a
Negro woman keepes: and at this place, for that the going vp of
the hill is very steepe, for the space of two leagues and better,
they doe alwaies accustome to take the moiles of 3 or 4 wagons,
and to place them altogether for the drawing vp of one wagon,
and so to come downe againe, and fetch up others in that order.
<span class="sidenote">Miles Philips his last wonderful escape.</span>
All which came very well to pass: for as it drew towards night when
most of the Wagoners were gone to draw vp their wagons, in this
sort I being alone had quickly filed off my bolts, and
so espying my time in the darke of the euening before
they returned downe the hill againe, I conueyed
my selfe into the woods there adioyning, carrying my
bolts and manacles with me, and a few biscuits, and two small
cheeses. And being come into the woods, I threw my yrons into
a thicke bush, and then couered them with mosse and other
things, and then shifted for myself as I might all that night. And
thus by the good prouidence of Almightie God, I was freed from
mine yrons all sauing the collar that was about my necke, and so
got my libertie the second time.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Wherein is shewed how I escaped to Guatimala, vpon the South
sea, and from thence to the port of Cauallos, where I got
passage to goe into Spaine, and of our arriuall at
Hauana, and our comming to Spaine, where I was againe
like to haue bene committed prisoner, and how through
the great mercy of God I escaped, and came home in
safetie into England in February 1582.</div>

<p>The next morning (day light being come) I perceiued by the
Sunne rising what way to take to escape their hands, for when I
fleede, I tooke the way into the woods vpon the left hand: and
hauing left that way that went to Mexico vpon my right hand, I
thought to keepe my course as the woods and mountaines lay, still
direct South as neere as I could: by meanes whereof I was sure
to conuey myselfe farre ynough from that way that went to
Mexico. And as I was thus going in the woods, I saw many
great fires made to the North not past a league from the mountaine
where I was, and trauelling thus in my bootes with mine
yron collar about my necke, and my bread and cheese, the very
same forenoon I mette with a company of Indians which were
hunting of Deere for their sustenance: to whom I spake in the
Mexican tongue, and told them how that I had of a long time bin
kept in prison by the cruel Spanyards, and did desire them to
helpe me to file off mine yron collar, which they willingly did:
reioycing greatly with me, that I was thus escaped out of the
Spanyards hands. Then I desired that I might haue one of
them to guide mee out of those desert mountaines towards the
South, which they also most willingly did: and so they brought
mee to an Indian towne 8. leagues distant from thence, named
Shalapa, where I stayed three dayes, for that I was somewhat
sickely. At which towne (with the gold that I had quilted in my
dublet) I bought me an horse of one of the Indians, which
cost me 6. pezos and so trauelling South, within the space of 2.
leagues I happened to ouertake a gray Frier, one that I had bene
familiar withall in Mexico, whom then I knew to be a zealous
good man, and one that did much lament the crueltie vsed
against vs by the Inquisitors, and truely hee vsed me very
courteously: and I having confidence in him did indeed tel him,
that I was minded to aduenture to see if I could get
<!--219.png-->
<span class="pagenum">222</span>
out of the sayd countrey if I could finde shipping, and
did therefore pray him of his ayde, direction, and aduise
herein, which he faithfully did, not only in directing me which
was my safest way to trauaile, but he also of himselfe kept me
company for the space, of three dayes, and euer as we
came to the Indian houses (who vsed and intertained vs well)
hee gathered among them in money to the value of 20. pezos,
which at my departure from him hee freely gaue vnto mee. So
came I to the citie of Guatimala vpon the South sea, which is
distant from Mexico about 250. leagues, where I stayed 6. dayes,
for that my horse was weake. And from thence I trauailed still
South and by East seuen dayes iourney, passing by certaine
Indian townes, vntill I came to an Indian towne distant from
Mexico, direct South 309. leagues. And here at this towne enquiring
to go to the Port de Cauallos in the Northeast sea, it was
answered that in trauailing thither I should not come to any
towne in 10. or 12. dayes iourney: so heere I hired two Indians
to be my guides, and I bought hennes, and bread to serue vs so
long time, and tooke with vs things to kindle fire euery night,
because of wilde beastes, and to dresse our meate: and euery
night when we rested, my Indian guides would make two great
fires, betweene the which we placed our selues, and my horse.
And in the night time we should heare the Lions roare, with
Tigres, Ounces, and other beastes, and some of them we should
see in the night, which had eyes shining like fire. And trauailing
thus for the space of twelue dayes, wee came at last to the port
of Cauallos vpon the East sea, distant from Guatimala South and
by East, two hundred leagues, and from Mexico 450. or thereabouts.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
This is a good harborough for shippes, and is without
either castle or bulwarke. I hauing dispatched away my guides,
went downe to the Hauen, where I saw certaine ships loden
chiefly with Canary-wines, where I spake with one of the Masters,
who asked me what Countrey man I was, and I told him that I
was borne in Granado, and he said, that then I was his countreyman.
I required him that I might passe home with him in his
ship, paying for my passage: and he said yea, so that I had a
safe conduct, or letter testimonial to shew, that he might incurre
no danger; for said be, it may be that you haue killed some man,
<!--220.png-->
<span class="pagenum">223</span>
or be indebted, and would therefore run away. To that I
answered, that there was not any such cause. Wel, in the end
we grew to a price, that for 60. pezos he would cary me into
Spaine: a glad man was I at this good hap, and I quickly solde
my horse, and made my prouision of hennes and bread to serue
me in my passage; And thus within 2. dayes after we set saile,
and neuer stayed vntill we came to Hauana, which is distant from
puerto de Cauallos by sea 500. leagues: where we found the
whole fleete of Spaine, which was bound home from the Indies.
And heere I was hired for a souldier to serue in the Admiral ship
of the same fleete, wherein the General himself went. There
landed while I was here 4. ships out of Spaine, being all full of
souldiers and ordinance, of which number there were 200 men
landed here, and 4. great brasse pieces of ordinance, although the
castle were before sufficiently prouided: 200. men more were sent
to Campeche, and certaine ordinance: 200. to Florida with ordinance:
and 100. lastly to S. Iohn de Vllua. As for ordinance
there they haue sufficient, and of the very same which was ours,
which we had in the Iesus, and those others which we had
planted in the place, where the Vice-roy betrayed M. Hawkins
our general, as hath bene declared. The sending of those
souldiers to euery of those Ports, and the strengthening of them,
was done by commandement from the king of Spaine, who wrote
also by them to the general of his fleete, giuing him in charge so
to doe, as also directing him what course he should keepe in his
comming home into Spaine, charging him in any hand not to
come nigh to the yles of A&ccedil;ores, but to keepe his course more to
the Northward, advertising him withal, what number and power
of French ships of warre, and other, Don Antonio had at that
time at Ter&ccedil;era, and the yles aforesaid: which the general of the
fleete wel considering, and what great store of riches he had to
bring home with him into Spaine, did in all very duetifully
observe and obey: for in trueth he had in his said fleete 37. saile of
ships, and in euery of them there was as good as 30. pipes of silver
one with another, besides great store of gold, Cochinilla, sugars,
hides, and Cana Fistula, with other apothecary drugs. This our
general, who was called Don Pedro de Guzman, did prouidently
take order for, for their most strength and defence, if neede should
be, to the vttermost of his power, and commanded vpon paine
of death, that neither passenger nor souldier should come aboord
without his sword and harquebush, with shot and powder, to the
<!--221.png-->
<span class="pagenum">224</span>
end that they might be the better able to encounter the fleete of
Don Antonio, if they should hap to meete with them, or any of
them: and euer as the weather was faire, the said general would
himselfe go aboord from one ship to another, to see that every
man had his ful prouision according to the commandement giuen.
Yet to speake truly what I thinke, two good tall ships of warre
would have made a foule spoil amongst them. For in all this
fleete there were not any that were strong and warlike appointed,
sauing only the Admiral, and Vice-admiral: And againe ouer
and besides the weaknesse and the ill furnishing of the rest, they
were all so deeply laden, that they had not bene able (if they had
bene charged) to haue held out any long fight. Wel, thus we
set saile, and had a very ill passage home, the weather was so
contrary. We kept our course in maner Northeast, and brought
our selues to the height of 42. degrees of latitude, to be sure not
to meete with Don Antonio his fleete, and were vpon our voyage
from the 4. of Iune, vntil the 10. of September, and neuer saw
land till we fell with the Arenas Gosdas hard by S. Lucar.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> And
there was an order taken that none should goe on shoare vntill
he had licence: as for me, I was knowen by one in the ship,
who told the Master that I was an Englishman, which (as God
would) it was my good hap to heare: for if I had not heard it, it
had cost me my life. Notwithstanding, I would not take any knowledge
of it, and seemed to be mery and pleasant, that we were all
come so wel in safety. Presently after, licence came that we
should go on shoare, and I pressed to be gone with the first:
howbeit, the Master came vnto me, and said, Sirra, you must goe
with me to Siuil by water: I knew his meaning well enough, and
that he meant there to offer me vp as a sacrifice to the Holy
house. For the ignorant zeal of a number of these superstitious
Spaniards is such, that they thinke that they haue done God good
seruice, when they haue brought a Lutheran heretike to the fire
to be burnt: for so do they account of vs. Wel, I perceiuing all
this, took vpon me not to suspect anything, but was still iocund
and mery: howbeit, I knew it stood me vpon to shift for my
selfe. And so wayting my time when the Master was in his
cabbin asleepe, I conueyed my selfe secretly downe by the
shrowds into the ship boate, and made no stay but cut the rope
wherewithal she was moared, and so by the cable haled on shore,
<!--222.png-->
<span class="pagenum">225</span>
where I leapt on land, and let the boate goe whither it would.
Thus by the helpe of God I escaped that day, and then neuer
stayed at S. Lucar, but went all night by the way which I had
seene other take toward Siuil: so that the next morning I came to
Siuil, and sought me out a workemaster, that I might fall to my
science, which was weauing of taffataes; and being intertained I
set my selfe close to my worke, and durst not for my life once to
stirre abroad for fear of being knowen: and being thus at my
worke, within 4 dayes after I heard one of my fellows say, that
he heard there was great inquiry made for an Englishman that
came home in the fleete: what an heretique Lutheran (quoth I)
was it, I would to God I might knowe him, surely I would present
him to the Holy house. And thus I kept still within doores
at my worke, and fained my selfe not well at ease, and that I
would labour as I might to get me new clothes. And continuing
thus for the space of 3. moneths I called for my wages, and
bought me all things new, different from the apparell that I did
weare at sea, and yet durst not be ouerbold to walke abroad:
and after vnderstanding that there were certaine English ships at
S. Lucar bound for England, I tooke a boat and went aboord one
of them, and desired the Master that I might haue passage with
him to goe into England, and told him secretly that I was one of
those which Captaine Hawkins did set on shore in the Indies:
he very courteously prayed me to haue him excused, for he
durst not meddle with me, and prayed me therefore to returne
from whence I came. Which when I perceiued, with a sorrowful
heart, God knoweth, I tooke my leaue of him, not without
watry cheekes.
<span class="sidenote">He commeth home in an English ship from
Maiorca.</span>
And then I went to S. Mary port, which is 3.
leagues from S. Lucar, where I put my selfe to be a souldier to
goe in the king of Spaines Gallies, which were bound
for Maiorca, and comming thither in the end of the
Christmas holidayes, I found there two English ships,
the one of London, and the other of the West
countrey, which were ready freighted and stayed but for a faire
winde. To the Master of the one, which was of the West
countrey went I, and told him that I had bene 2. yeeres in
Spaine to learne the language, and that I was now desirous to
goe home and see my friends, for that I lacked maintenance:
and so hauing agreed with him for my passage, I tooke shipping.
And thus through the prouidence of Almighty God, after 16.
yeeres absence, hauing sustained many and sundry great troubles
<!--223.png-->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
and miseries, as by this discourse appeareth, I came home to this
my natiue countrey of England in the yeere 1582. in the moneth
of February, in the ship called the Landret, and arriued at
Poole.</p>

The trauailes of Iob Hortop, which Sir Iohn Hawkins set on
land within the bay of Mexico, after his departure from
the Hauen of S. Iohn de Vllua in Nueua Espanna, the 8.
of October 1568.</div>

<p>Not vntruely nor without cause said Iob the faithfull seruant
of God (whom the sacred Scriptures tell vs, to haue dwelt in the
land of Hus) that man being borne of a woman, liuing a short
time, is replenished with many miseries: which some know by
reading of histories, many by the view of others calamities, and I
by experience in my selfe, as this present Treatise insuing shall
shew.</p>

<p>It is not vnknowen vnto many, that I Iob Hortop poudermaker
was borne at Bourne, a towne in Lincolnshire, from my
age of twelue yeeres brought vp in Redriffe neere London,
with M. Francis Lee, who was the Queenes Maiesties powdermaker,
whom I serued, vntil I was prest to goe on the 3. voyage
to the West Indies, with the right worshipful Sir Iohn
Hawkins, who appointed me to be one of the Gunners in her
Maiesties ships called the Iesus of Lubeck, who set saile from
Plimmouth in the moneth of October 1567. hauing with him
another ship of her Maiesties, called the Minion, and foure ships
of his owne, namely the Angel, the Swallow, the Iudith, and the
William and Iohn. He directed his Vice-admiral, that if foule
weather did separate them, to meete at the Iland of Tenerif.
After which by the space of seuen dayes and seuen nights, we had
such stormes at sea, that we lost our long boats and a pinnesse,
with some men: comming to the Isle of Tenerif, there our
Generall heard that his Vice-admirall with the Swallow, and the
William and Iohn were at the Iland called Gomera, where finding
his Vice-admirall, he anchored, tooke in fresh water, and set
saile for Cape Blank, where in the way wee tooke a Portugal
carauel, laden with fish called Mullets: from thence we sailed to
cape Verde. In our course thither we met a Frenchman of
Rochel called captaine Bland, who had taken a Portugal carauel,
whom our vice admiral chased and tooke. Captaine Drake,
<!--224.png-->
<span class="pagenum">227</span>
now Sir Francis Drake was made master and captaine of the
Carauel, and so we kept our way till we came to cape Verde,
and there we anchored, tooke our boates, and set souldiers on
shore. Our Generall was the first that leapt on land, and with
him Captaine Dudley: there we tooke certaine Negroes, but not
without damage to our selues. For our Generall, Captaine
Dudley, and 8. other of our company were hurt with poysoned
arrowes: about nine dayes after, the 8. that were
wounded died.
<span class="sidenote">A remedie against poysoned arrowes.</span>
Our general was taught by a Negro,
to draw the poyson out of his wound with a cloue of
garlike, whereby he was cured. From thence wee
went to Sierra leona, where be monstrous fishes called Sharkes,
which will deuoure men. I amongst others was sent in the
Angell with two Pinnesses into the riuer called Calousa, to seeke
two Carauels that were there trading with the Negros: wee tooke
one of them with the Negros, and brought them away.</p>

<p>In this riuer in the night time we had one of our pinnesses
bulged by a sea-horse, so that our men swimming about the
riuer were all taken into the other pinnesses, except two that
tooke hold one of another, and were caried away by the sea-horse.
This monster<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> hath the iust proportion of a horse, sauing
that his legs be short, his teeth very great, and a span in length:
hee vseth in the night to goe on land into the woods, seeking at
vnawares to deuoure the Negroes in their cabbins, whom they
by their vigilancie preuent, and kill him in this maner. The
Negroes keepe watch, and diligently attend their comming, and
when they are gone into the woods, they forthwith lay a great
tree ouerthwart the way, so that at their returne, for that their
legs be so short, they cannot goe ouer it: then the Negroes set
vpon them with their bowes, arrowes and darts, and so destroy
them.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
Hippopotamus.</div>

<p>From thence we entred the riuer called the Casserroes, where
there were other Carauels trading with the Negroes, and them
we tooke. In this Iland betwixt the riuer and the maine, trees
grow with Oisters vpon them. There grow Palmito trees, which
bee as high as a ships maine mast, and on their tops grow nuts,
wine and oyle, which they call Palmito wine and Palmito oyle.
The Plantan tree also groweth in that countrey; the tree is as
bigge is a mans thigh, and as high as a firre pole, the leaues
<!--225.png-->
<span class="pagenum">228</span>
thereof be long and broad, and on the top grow the fruit which
are called Plantanos: they are crooked and a cubite long, and
as bigge as a mans wrist, they growe on clusters: when they be
ripe they be very good and daintie to eate: Sugar is not more
delicate in taste then they be.</p>

<p>From thence with the Angel, the Iudith, and the two pinnesses,
we sailed to Sierra leona, where our Generall at that time was,
who with the captaines and souldiers went vp into the riuer
called Taggarin, to take a towne of the Negroes, where he found
three kings of that countrie with fiftie thousand Negroes besieging
the same towne, which they could not take in many yeeres
before when they had warred with it. Our General made a
breach, entred, and valiantly tooke the towne, wherein we found
fiue Portugals which yeelded themselues to his mercie, and hee
saued their liues: we tooke and caried thence for traffique to
the West Indies 500. Negroes. The three kings droue 7000.
Negroes into the sea at low water, at the point of the land, where
they were all drowned in the Oze, for that they could not take
their canoas to saue themselues. Wee returned backe againe in
our pinnesses to the ships, and there tooke in fresh water, and
made ready sayle towards Rio grande. At our comming thither
we entred with the Angel, the Iudith, and the 2. pinnesses, and
found there seuen Portugal Caruels, which made great fight with
vs. In the ende by Gods helpe wee wonne the victory, and
droue them to the shore, from whence with the Negroes they
fled, and we fetcht the caruels from the shore into the riuer.
The next morning M. Francis Drake with his caruel, the Swallow,
and the William and Iohn came into the riuer, with captaine
Dudley and his souldiers, who landed being but a hundred
souldiers, and fought with seuen thousand Negroes, burned the
towne, and returned to our Generall with, the losse of one
man.</p>

<p>In that place there be many muske-cats, which breed in hollow
trees: the Negroes take them in a net, and put them in a cage,
and nourish them very daintily, and take the muske from them
with a spoone.</p>

<p>Now we directed our course from Guinea towards the West
Indies.</p>

<p>And by the way died Captaine Dudley.</p>

<p>In sayling towards the Indies, the first land that we escryed,
was the Iland called Dominica, where at our comming we
<!--226.png-->
<span class="pagenum">229</span>
anchored, and tooke in fresh water and wood for our prouision:
which done, we sayled towards the Iland called Margarita, where
our Generall in despite of the Spaniards anchored, landed, and
tooke in fresh victuals. A mile off the Iland there is a rocke in
the sea, wherein doe breede many fowles like vnto Barnacles: in
the night we went out in our boates, and with cudgels we killed
many of them, and brought them with many of their egs aboord
with vs: their egges be as bigge as Turkies egges, and speckled
like them. We did eate them, and found them very good
meate.</p>

<p>From thence wee sayled to Burboroata, which is in the maine
land of the West Indies: there we came in, mored our ships, and
taried two moneths trimming and dressing our ships, and in the
meane time traded with certaine Spanyards of that countrey.
There our Generall sent vs vnto a towne called Placencia,
(which stood on a high hil) to haue intreated a Bishop that
dwelt there for his fauour and friendship in their lawes, who
hearing of our comming, for feare forsooke the town.</p>

<p>In our way vp the hil to Placencia, wee found a monstrous
venomous worme with two heads: his body was as bigge as a mans
arme, and a yard long: our master Robert Barret did cut him in
sunder with his sword, and it made it as blacke as if it were
coloured with ynke.</p>

<p>Heere be many Tygers, monstrous and furious beasts, which
by subtiltie deuoure and destroy many men: they vse the traded
wayes, and wil shew themselues twise or thrise to the trauellers,
and so depart secretly, lurking till they be past, then suddenly
and at vnawares they leape vpon them and deuoure them: they
had so vsed two of our company, had not one of them, looked
behind. Our Generall sent three ships vnto the Iland called
Cora&ccedil;ao,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> to make prouision for the rest, where they remayned
vntill his comming.
<span class="sidenote">Rio de la Hacha taken.</span>
Hee sent from thence the Angel and the
Iudith to Rio de Hacha,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> where we anchored before the town.
The Spaniards shot three pieces at vs from the shore, whom we
requited with two of ours, and shotte through the Gouernours
house: we wayed anchor, and anchored againe without shot of
the towne, where wee rid fiue dayes in despite of the Spanyards,
and their shot. In the meane space there came a Caruel of
aduise from S. Domingo, whom with the Angel, and the Iudith
<!--227.png-->
<span class="pagenum">230</span>
wee chased and droue to the shore: we fetcht him from thence
in spite of 200. Spaniards hargubush shot, and anchored againe
before the towne, and rid there with them, till our Generals
comming, who anchored, landed his men, and valiantly
tooke the Towne, with the losse of one man,
whose name was Thomas Surgeon: wee landed and
planted on the shore for our safeties, our field ordinance: we
droue the Spaniards vp into the country aboue two leagues
whereby they were inforced to trade with our General, to whom
he sold most part of his Negros.</p>

At the mouth of the Hacha river, Magdalena State, Columbia.</div>

<p>In this riuer we killed a monstrous Lagarto or Crocodile in
this port at sunne set: seuen of vs went in the pinnesse vp into
the Riuer, carying with vs a dogge, vnto whom with ropeyarn we
bound a great hooke of steele, with a chaine that had a swiuel,
which we put vnder the dogs belly, the point of the hooke
comming ouer his back fast bound, as aforesaid: we put him
ouer board, and veered out our rope by litle and litle, rowing
away with our boate: the Lagarto came and presently swallowed
vp the dogge, then did we rowe hard till we had choked him: he
plunged and made a wonderfull stirre in the water: we leapt on
shore, and haled him on land: he was 23. foote by the rule,
headed like a hogge, in body like a serpent, full of scales as broad
as a sawcer: his taile long and full of knots as bigge as a fawcon
shotte: he hath foure legs, his feete haue long nailes like vnto a
dragon: we opened him, tooke out his guts, flayed him; dried
his skinne, and stuffed it with straw, meaning to haue brought it
home, had not the ship bin cast away. This, monster will cary
away and deuoure both men and horse.</p>

<p>From hence we shaped our course to Santa Martha,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> where
we landed, traded and sold certaine Negroes: there two of our
company killed a monstrous adder, going towards his caue with a
Conie in his mouth: his body was as bigge as any mans thigh,
and seuen foote long, vpon his tayle he had sixteene knottes,
euery one as bigge as a great walnut, which they say, doe shew
his age: his colour was greene and yellow: they opened him;
and found two conies in his belly.</p>

<p>From thence wee sayled to Cartagena,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> where we went in,
mored our Shippes, and would haue traded with them, but they
<!--228.png-->
<span class="pagenum">231</span>
durst not for feare of the King: wee brought vp the Minion
against the Castle, and shotte at the Castle and Towne: then we
landed in an Iland, where were many gardens: there in a caue
we found certaine Botijos of wine, which wee brought away with
vs, in recompence whereof, our Generall commanded, to be set
on shore woollen and linnen cloth, to the value thereof. From
hence by foule weather wee were forced to seeke the Port of
Saint John de Vllua. In our way thwart of Campeche we met
with a Spaniard, a small ship, who was bound for Santo Domingo:
he had in him a Spaniard called Augustin de villa nueua, who
was the man that betrayed all the Noble men in the Indies, and
caused them to be beheaded, wherefore he with two Friers fled
to S. Domingo: them we tooke and brought with vs into the
Port of S. Iohn de Vllua. Our Generall made great account of
him, and vsed him like a Noble man: howbeit in the ende he
was one of them that betrayed vs. When wee had mored our
ships, and landed, we mounted the Ordinance that wee found
there in the Ilande, and for our safeties kept watch and warde.
<span class="sidenote">Don Martin de Henriquez the trecherous
Vice-roy.</span>
The next daye after wee discouered the Spanish fleete, whereof
Lu&ccedil;on a Spanyard was Generall: with him came a
Spanyard called Don Martin Henriquez, whom the
king of Spaine sent to be his Vice-roy of the Indies.
He sent a Pinnesse with a flagge of truce vnto our
Generall, to knowe of what Countrey those Shippes were that
rode there in the King of Spaines Port: who sayd they were the
Queene of Englands ships, which came in there for victuals for
their money: wherefore if your Generall will come in here, he
shall giue me victuals and all other necessaries, and I will goe out
on the one side of the Port, and he shall come in on the other
side. The Spanyard returned for answere, that he was a Vice-roy,
and had a thousand men, and therefore he would come in.
Our Generall sayd, If he be a Vice-roy, I represent my Queenes
person, and I am a Vice-roy as well as he: and if he haue a
thousand men, my powder and shot will take the better place.
Then the Vice-roy after counsell among themselues, yeelded to
our Generals demand, swearing by his King and his Crowne, by
his commission and authority that he had from his King, that hee
would performe it, and thereupon pledges were giuen on both
parts. Our Generall bearing a godly and Christian minde, voyde
of fraude and deceit, iudged the Spanyards to haue done the
like, deliuered to them sixe gentlemen, not doubting to haue
<!--229.png-->
<span class="pagenum">232</span>
receiued the like from them: but the faithlesse Spanyardes, in
costly apparell gaue of the basest of their company, as afterwardes
it was well knowen. These things finished, proclamation was
made on both sides, that on payne of death no occasion should
be giuen, whereby any quarrel should grow to the breach of the
league, and then they peaceably entred the port, with great
triumph on both sides.</p>

<p>The Spaniards presently brought a great Hulke, a ship of sixe
hundred, and mored her by the side of the Minion, and they cut
out ports in their other ships, planting their ordinance towards vs, in
the night they filled the Hulke with men, to lay the Minion
aboord, as the sequel did shew, which made our General doubtful
of their dealings: wherefore, for that he could speake the
Spanish tongue, he sent Robert Barret aboord the Vice-roy, to
knowe his meaning in those dealings, who willed him with his
company to come in to him, whom he commanded presently to
be set in the bilbowes, and forthwith a Cornet (for a watchword
among the false Spaniards) was sounded for the
enterprising of their pretended treason against our
Generall,
<span class="sidenote">Augustine de villa nueua a most thanklesse
traytour.</span>
whom Augustine de villa noua sitting at
dinner with him, should then presently haue killed
with a poynado which hee had priuily in his sleeue, was espyed
and preuented by one Iohn Chamberlayne, who tooke the
poynado out of his sleeue. Our General hastily rose vp, and
commanded him to be put prisoner in the Stewards roome, and
to be kept with two men. The faithlesse Spanyards, thinking all
things to their desire had bene finished, suddenly sounded a
Trumpet, and therewith three hundred Spaniards entred the
Minion, whereat our General with a loude and fierce voyce
called vnto vs, saying, God and Saint George, vpon those
traiterous villaines, and rescue the Minion, I trust in God the day
shalbe ours: and with that the Mariners and souldiers leapt out
of the Iesus of Lubeck into the Minion, and beat out the
Spanyards, and with a shot out of her fiered the Spaniards Vice
admirall, where the most part of 300. Spanyards were spoyled,
and blowen ouer boord with powder. Their Admirall also was
on fire halfe an houre: we cut our cables, wound off our ships,
and presently fought with them: they came vpon vs on euery
side, and continued the fight from ten of the clocke vntill it was
night: they killed all our men that were on shore in the Iland,
sauing three, which by swimming got aboord the Iesus of
<!--230.png-->
<span class="pagenum">233</span>
Lubeck.
<span class="sidenote">One of those three was Iob Hortop the reporter
hereof. Four Spanish ships sunke.</span>
They sunke the Generals ship called the
Angel, and tooke the Swallow: the Spaniards Admirall
had aboue threescore shot through her: many of his
men were spoyled: four other of their ships were
sunke. There were in that fleete, and that came
from the shore to rescue them, fifteene hundred: we
slew of them fiue hundred and fourtie, as we were credibly
informed by a note that came to Mexico. In this fight the Iesus
of Lubeck had fiue shotte through her mayne Mast: her foremast
was shotte in sunder vnder the bounds with a chayne
shotte, and her hull was wonderfully pearced with shotte,
therefore it was vnpossible to bring her away. They set
two of their owne Shippes on fire, intending therewith to
haue burnt the Iesus of Lubeck, which we preuented by
cutting our cables in the halse, and winding off by our sternefast.</p>

<p>The Minion was forced to set saile and stand off from vs, and
come to an anker without shot of the Island. Our Generall
couragiously cheered vp his souldiers and gunners, and called to
Samuel his page for a cup of Beere, who brought it him in a
siluer cup, and hee drinking to all men willed the gunners to
stand by their Ordinance lustily like men. He had no sooner
set the cup out of his hand, but a demy Culuerin shot stroke
away the cup and a Coopers plane that stoode by the main mast,
and ranne out on the other side of the ship: which nothing
dismaid our Generall, for he ceased not to incourage vs, saying,
feare nothing, for God, who hath preserued me from this shot,
will also deliuer vs from these traitours and villaines. Then
Captaine Bland meaning to haue turned out of the port, had his
maine mast stroke ouer boord with a chaine shot that came from
the shore, wherefore he ankered, fired his ship, tooke his pinnesse
with all his men, and came aboord the Iesus of Lubek to
haue runne away from him, he answered, that he was not minded
to haue run away from him, but his intent was to haue turned vp,
our Generall, who said vnto him, that he thought he would not
and to haue laid the weathermost ship of the Spanish fleete
aboord, and fired his ship in hope therewith to haue set on fire
the Spanish fleete, hee said if he had done so he had done well.
With this, night came on. Our Generall commanded the Minion,
for safegard of her masts to be brought vnder the Iesus of
Lubecks lee: he willed M. Francis Drake to come in with the
<!--231.png-->
<span class="pagenum">234</span>
Iudith, and to lay the Minion aboord, to take in men and other
things needfull, and to goe out, and so he did.</p>

<p>At night when the wind came off the shore, wee set sayle, and
went out in dispite of the Spanyards and their shot, where wee
ankered, with two ankers vnder the Island, the wind being
Northerly, which was wonderfull dangerous, and wee feared euery
houre to be driuen with the lee shore. In the end when the
wind came larger, we waied anker, and set saile, seeking the
riuer of Panuco for water, whereof we had very little, and victuals
were so scarce, that we were driuen to eate hides, cats, rats,
parrats, monkies, and dogges: wherefore our Generall was
forced to diuide his company into two parts, for there was a
mutinie among them for want of victuals: and some said
that they had rather be on the shore to shift for themselues
amongst the enemies, then to serue on ship-boord. He
asked them who would go on shore, and who would
tarry on ship-boord, those that would goe on shore, he willed
to goe on foremast, and those that would tarrie, on baft mast:
fourescore and sixteene of vs were willing to depart. Our
Generall gaue vnto euery one of vs sixe yards of Roane cloth, and
money to them that demanded it.
<span class="sidenote">About an hundred Englishmen landed.</span>
When we were landed, he
came vnto vs, where friendly imbracing euery one of vs, he was
greatly grieued that he was forced to leaue vs behind
him, he counselled vs to serue God, and to loue one
another, and thus courteously he gaue vs a sorowful
farewell, and promised if God sent him safe home, he
would do what he could, that so many of vs as liued should be
brought into England, and so he did.</p>

<p>Since my returne into England I haue heard that many misliked
that he left vs so behind him, and brought away Negroes:
but the reason is this, for them he might haue had victuals, or
any other thing needfull, if by foule weather hee had bene driuen
vpon the Islands, which for gold nor siluer he could not haue
had.</p>

<p>And thus our Generall departed to his ship, and we remained
on land, where for our safeties, fearing the wild Indians that were
about vs, we kept watch all night, and at Sunne rising wee
marched on our way, three and three in a ranke, vntill that we
came into a fielde vnder a groue, where the Indians came vpon
vs, asking vs what people we were, and how we came there.
Two of our company, namely Anthony Goddard and Iohn
<!--232.png-->
<span class="pagenum">235</span>
Cornish, for that they could speake the Spanish tongue, went to
them and said wee were Englishmen, that neuer came in that
countrey before, and that we had fought with the Spaniards, and for
that we lacked victuals, our Generall set vs on shore: they asked vs
whither we intended to goe, we said to Panuco. The Captaine
of the Indians willed vs to giue vnto them some of our clothes
and shirts, which we did: then he bad vs giue them all, but we
would not so doe, whereupon Iohn Cornish was then slaine with
an arrow, which an Indian boy that stoode by the Captaine shot
at him, wherefore hee stroke the boy on the necke with his bow,
that he lay for dead, and willed vs to follow him, who brought vs
into a great fielde where we found fresh water: hee bad vs sit
downe about the pond and drinke, and he with his company
would goe in the meane space to kill fiue or sixe Deere, and
bring them vs. We taryed there till three of the clocke, but they
came not: there one of our company whose name was Iohn
Cooke, with foure other departed from vs into a groue to seeke
reliefe, where presently they were taken by the Indians, and
stript as naked as euer they were borne, and so returned to vs.</p>

<p>Then we diuided ourselues into two parts, halfe to Anthony
Goddard, and the rest to Iames Collier, and thus seuerally we
sought for Panuco. Anthony Goddard with his company bid
vs farewell, they passed a riuer, where the Indians robbed many
of them of their clothes, and so passing on their way, came to a
stony hill, where they stayed.
<span class="sidenote">8. Englishmen slaine.</span>
Iames Collier with his company
that day passed the same riuer, and were also robbed, and one
of them slaine by chance: wee came that night vnto the hill,
where Anthony Goddard and his company rested, there we
remained til morning, and then we marched altogether from
thence, entring betweene two groues, where the Indians robbed
vs of all our clothes, and left vs naked, they hurt many, and
killed eight of vs. Three dayes after we came to
another riuer, there the Indians shewed vs the way
to Panuco, and so left vs: we passed the riuer into
the wildernes, where we made wreaths of greene grasse, which
we wound about our bodies, to keepe vs from the Sunne, and
gnats of that Countrey. We trauelled there seuen dayes, and
seuen nights, before we came to Panuco, feeding on nothing but
roots, and Guiauos,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> a fruit like figs. At our comming to the
<!--233.png-->
<span class="pagenum">236</span>
riuer of Panuco two Spanish horsemen came ouer vnto vs in a
Canowe: they asked vs how long we had bene in the wildernesse,
and where our generall was, for they knewe vs to be of the
company that had fought with their countrimen: we told them
seuen dayes and seuen nights, and for lacke of victuals our
Generall set vs on shore, and he was gone away with his ships.
They returned to their Gouernour, who sent them with fiue
Canowes to bring vs all ouer, which done, they set vs in aray,
where a hundred horsemen with their lances, came forceably vpon
vs, but did not hurt vs, they carried vs prisoners to Panuco,
where we remained one night. In the riuer of Panuco there is a
fish like a calfe, the Spanyards call it a Mollatin, hee hath a stone
in his head, which the Indians vse for the disease of the Collicke,
in the night he commeth on land and eateth grasse. I haue
eaten of it, and it eateth not much vnlike to bacon. From thence
we were sent to Mexico, which is 90 leagues from Panuco. In
our way thither, 20 leagues from the sea side, I did see white
Crabs running vp and downe the sands, I haue eaten of them,
and they be very good meat. There groweth a fruit which the
Spanyards call Auocottes, it is proportioned like an egge, and as
blacke as a cole, hauing a stone in it, and it is an excellent good
fruit.
<span class="sidenote">A manifold Magueis.</span>
There also groweth a strange tree which they
call Magueis, it serueth them to many vses, below by
the root they make a hole, whereat they do take out
of it twise euery day a certeine kind of licour, which they seeth
in a great kettle, till the third part be consumed, and that it waxe
thick, it is as sweet as any hony, and they do eat it. Within 20.
daies after that they haue taken al the licour from it, it withereth,
and they cut it down, and vse it as we vse our hempe here in
England, which done, they conuert it to many vses: of some
part they make mantles, ropes, and threed: of the ends they make
needles to sow their saddles, pannels, and other furniture for their
horses: of the rest they make tyles, to couer their houses, and
they put it to many other purposes.</p>

<p>And thus we came to Mexico, which is seuen or eight miles
about, seated in a great fen, inuironed with 4 hils, it hath but
two wayes of entrance, and it is full of creeks, in the which in
their Canowes they passe from place to place, and to the Islands
there within. In the Indies ordinarily three times a yeere bee
wonderfull earthquakes, which put the people in great feare and
danger: during the time of two yeeres that I was in Mexico, I
<!--234.png-->
<span class="pagenum">237</span>
saw them sixe times; when they come they throw downe trees,
houses, and Churches. There is a citie 25. leagues from Mexico,
called Tlaxcalla, which is inhabited with an hundred thousand
Indians, they goe in white shirts, linnen breeches, and long
mantles, and the women weare about them a garment much like
vnto a flannell petticote. The kings pallace was the first place
wee were brought vnto in Mexico, where without we were willed
to sit downe. Much people, men, women, and children came
wondring about vs, many lamented our misery, and some of their
clergy asked vs if we were Christians, we said, we praised God,
we were as good Christians as they: they asked how they might
know that, we said by our confessions. From thence we were
caried in a Canow to a Tanners house, which standeth a little
from the citie: the next morning two friers and two priests came
thither to vs, and willed vs to blesse our selues, and say our
prayers in the Latin tongue, that they might vnderstand vs, many
of our company did so, wherevpon they returned to the viceroy,
and told him that we were good Christians, and that they liked
vs well, and then they brought vs much reliefe, with clothes, our
sicke men were sent to their Hospitals, where many were cured,
and many died. From the Tanners house we were led to a
gentlemans place, where vpon paine of death we were charged to
abide, and not to come into the citie, thither we had all things
necessary brought vs: on Sundayes and holy dayes much people
came, and brought vs great reliefe.</p>

<p>The viceroy practised to hang vs, and caused a paire of new
gallowes to be set vp, to haue executed vs, whereunto the noblemen
of that countrey would not consent, but prayed him to stay
vntil the ship of aduise brought newes from the king of Spaine,
what should be done with vs, for they said they could not find
any thing by vs, whereby they might lawfully put vs to death.</p>

<p>The viceroy then commanded vs to be sent to an Island there
by, and he sent for the Bishop of Mexico, who sent foure priests
to the Island, to examine and confesse vs, who said, that the
viceroy would burne vs, when wee were examined and confessed
according to the lawes of the countrey. They returned to the
Bishop, and told him that we were very good Christians. The
Bishop certified the viceroy of our examinations and confessions,
and said that wee were good Christians, therefore he would not
meddle with vs. Then the viceroy sent for our master R.
Barret, whom he kept prisoner in his pallace, vntill the fleete
<!--235.png-->
<span class="pagenum">238</span>
was departed for Spaine. The rest of vs he sent to a towne
seuen leagues from Mexico called Tescuco, to card wooll among
the Indian slaves, which drudgery we disdained, and concluded
to beat our masters, and so we did: wherefore they sent to the
viceroy, desiring him for Gods sake and our Ladies, to send
for vs, for they would not keepe vs any longer, they said that
we were deuils and no men.</p>

<p>The viceroy sent for vs, and imprisoned vs in a house in
Mexico, from thence he sent Anthony Goddard, and some other
of our company with him into Spaine with Lu&ccedil;on, the Generall
that tooke vs: the rest of vs staied in Mexico two yeres after,
and then were sent prisoners into Spaine, with Don Iuan de
Valesco de Varre, admirall and generall of the Spanish fleet, who
caried with him in his ship, to be presented to the King of Spaine,
the anatomie of a giant, which was sent from China to Mexico,
to the Viceroy Don Martin Henriquez, to bee sent to the king of
Spaine for a great wonder. It did appere by the anatomie, that he
was of a monstrous size, the skull of his head was neere as bigge as
halfe a bushel, his necke-bones, shoulder plates, arme bones, and
all other lineaments of his other partes, were huge and monstrous
to behold, the shanke of his legge from the ankle to the knee,
was as long as from any mans ankle vp to his wast, and of bignesse
accordingly.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A description of ginger.</span>
At this time, and in this ship, were also sent to be presented
to the king of Spaine, two chestes full of earth with ginger growing
in them, which were also sent from China, to be sent to the king
of Spaine. The ginger runneth in the ground like to
liccoras, the blades grow out of it in length and proportion
like vnto the blades of wild garlicke, which
they cut euery fifteene dayes, they vse to water them twise a day,
as we doe our herbes here in England, they put the blades in
their pottage, and vse them in their other meates, whose excellent
sauour and tast is very delightfull, and procureth a good appetite.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

Ginger is the underground stem (rhizome) of <i>Zingiber officinal</i>. The
rhizome throws up barren leafy reed like stems 3 or 4 feet high, and occasionally
flowering stems. The flowers are arranged in a cone-shaped spike,
each in the axil of a large greenish-yellow bract. The corolla is orange-yellow,
divided into three long segments. One of the staminodes forms a
large purple three-lobed lip. Ginger is probably a native of tropical Asia,
but is now cultivated in all warm countries. The name occurs in a list of
imports into Alexandria in the second century, and during the middle ages
was evidently an important article of commerce. It is often mentioned in
the Old English leech-books of the eleventh century; and during the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries it was the commonest spice, next to pepper, though
1 lb. of it cost as much as a sheep, 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> (Rogers, "History of Agriculture
and Prices in England.")</div>

When we were shipped, in the Port of S. Iohn de Vllua,
the Generall called our master Robert Barret and
vs with him into his cabbin, and asked vs if wee
would fight against Englishmen, if we met them at the sea,
we said that we would not fight against our Crowne, but
if we met with any other, we would do what we were able.
He said if we had said otherwise, he would not haue
beleeued vs, and for that we should be the better vsed, and haue
allowance as other men had: and he gaue a charge to euery one
of vs, according to our knowledge, Robert Barret was placed
with the pilote, I was put in the gunners roome, William Cawse
with the boat-swaine, Iohn Beare with the quarter-masters, Edward
Rider and Geffrey Giles, with the ordinary mariners, Richard the
masters boy attended on him and the pilote: shortly after we
departed from the port of S. Iohn de Vllua with all the fleete of
Spaine, for the port called Hauana: wee were 26. dayes sayling
thither. There wee came in, ankered, tooke in fresh water, and
stayed 16. dayes for the fleete of Nombre de Dios, which is the
fleet that brings the treasure from Peru.</p>

<p>The Generall of that fleet was called Diego Flores de Valdes.
After his comming, when he had watred his ships, both the
fleetes ioyned in one, and Don Iuan de Velasco de Varre was
the first fifteen daies Generall of both the fleets, who turning
through the chanell of Bahama, his pilote had like to haue cast
away all the fleet vpon the Cape called Cannaueral, which was
preuented by me Iohn Hortop, and our master Robert Barret:
for I being in the second watch escried land, and called to
Robert Barret, bidding him looke ouer boord, for I saw land
vnder the lee-bow of the ship: he called to the boat-swaine, and
bid him let flie the fore saile sheat, and lay the helm vpon the
lee, and cast the ship about. When we were cast about, we
were but in seuen fathome water: we shot off a piece, giuing
aduice to the fleet to cast about, and so they did: For this we
were beloued of the Generall, and all the fleet. The Generall
was in a great rage, and swore by the king, that he would hang
his pilote: for he said, that twise before he had almost cast away
<!--237.png-->
<span class="pagenum">240</span>
the Admirall. When it was day, he commanded a piece to be
shot off to call to councill: the other Admirall in his ship came
vp to him, and asked what the matter was, he said, that his pilote
had cast away his ship and all the fleet, had it not bene for two
of the Englishmen, and therefore he would hang him. The
other Admirall with many faire words perswaded him to the
contrary.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A sea-monster in the shape of a man.</span>
When we came in the height of Bermuda, we discouered a
monster in the sea, who shewed himselfe three times
vnto vs from the middle vpwards, in which parts hee
was proportioned like a man, of the complection of a
Mulato, or tawny Indian. The Generall did commaund
one of his clearks to put it in writing, and hee certified
the King and his Nobles thereof. Presently after this, for the
space of sixteene dayes we had wonderful foule weather, and then
God sent vs a faire wind, vntill such time as we discouered the
Iland called Faial.</p>

<p>On S. Iames day we made rackets, wheeles, and other fireworkes,
to make pastime that night, as it is the order of the
Spaniards. When we came neere the land, our master R. Barret
conferred with vs, to take the pinnesse one night, when we came
on the Iland called Ter&ccedil;era, to free our selues from the danger
and bondage that we were going into, whereunto we agreed:
none had any pinnesse asterne then but our ship, which gaue
great courage to our enterprize: we prepared a bagge of bread,
and a Botijo of water, which would haue serued vs nine dayes,
and prouided our selues to goe: our Master borrowed a small
compasse of the Master gunner of the ship, who lent it him, but
suspected his intent, and closely made the Generall priuy to it,
who for a time dissembled the matter. In the ende seeing our
pretense, he called R. Barret, commanding his head to bee put
in the stocks, and a great payre of yron bolts on his legs, and
the rest of vs, to be set in the stocks by the legs. Then he
willed a peece to be shot off, and he sent the pinnesse for the
other Admirall, and all the captaines, masters, and pilotes of
both fleetes to come aboord of him. He commanded the maine-yard
to be strooke downe, and to put 2. pullies, on euery
yard-arme one; the hangman was called, and we were willed to
confesse our selues, for he swore by the king that he would
hang vs.</p>

<p>When the other Admiral, and the rest were come aboord, he
<!--238.png-->
<span class="pagenum">241</span>
called them into his counsel-chamber, and told them that he
would hang the master of the Englishmen, and all his company.
The Admirall, whose name was Diego Flores de Valdes, asked
him wherefore: he sayd, that we had determined to rise in the
night with the pinnesse, and with a ball of fire-worke to set the
ship on fire, and goe our wayes: therefore, sayd he, I will haue
you the Captaines, Masters, and Pilotes, to set your hands vnto
that, for I sweare by the king that I will hang them, Diego Flores
de Valdes answered, I nor the Captaines, Masters, and Pilotes
wil not set our hands to that, for hee said, if he had bin prisoner
as we were, he would haue done the like himselfe. He counselled
him to keepe vs fast in prison, till he came into Spaine,
and then send vs to the Contratation house in Siuil, where, if
we had deserued death the law would passe on vs, for hee would
not haue it said that in such a fleet as that was, sixe men and a
boy should take the pinnesse, and goe away, and so he returned
to his ship againe.</p>

<p>When he was gone, the Generall came to the maine mast to
vs, and swore by the king, that we should not come out of the
stocks til we came into Spaine: within 16. dayes after we came
ouer the Bar of S. Lucar, and came vp to the Hurcados, then he
put vs into a pinnesse in the stocks, and sent vs prisoners to the
Contratation house in Siuil. From thence after one yere we
brake prison, on S. Steuens day at night, 7. of our company
escaped, Robert Barret, I Iob Hortop, Iohn Emerie, Humphrey
Roberts, and Iohn Gilbert were taken, and brought backe to the
contratation house, where we remained in the stocks till twelfe
tide was past. Then our keeper put vp a petition to the Iudge
of the contratation house, that we might be sent to the great
prison house in Siuil, for that we broke prison, whereupon we
were presently led thither, where we remained one moneth, and
from thence to the castell of the Inquisition house in Triana,
where wee continued one yere: which expired, they brought vs
out in procession, euery one of vs hauing a candle in his hand,
and the coate with S. Andrewes crosse on our backs: they
brought vs vp on an high scaffold, that was set vp in the place
of S. Francis, which is in the chiefe street of Siuill: there they
set vs downe vpon benches: euery one in his degree, and against
vs on another scaffold sate all the Iudges, and the Clergy on
their benches: the people wondered, and gazed on vs, some
pittying our cases, others said, burne those heretikes.
<span class="sidenote">Robert Barret and Iohn Gilbert burned.</span>
When we
<!--239.png-->
<span class="pagenum">242</span>
had sit there two houres, we had a sermon made to vs: after
which one called Bresinia, secretarie to the Inquisition, went vp
into the pulpit with the processe, and called Robert Barret and
Iohn Gilbert, whom two familiars of the Inquisition
brought from the scaffold before the Iudges, where
the secretarie read the sentence, which was that they
should be burnt, and so they returned to the scaffold,
and were burnt.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Job Hortop his condemnation.</span>
Then I Job Hortop, and Iohn Bone were called, and brought
to the place, as before, where we heard our sentence,
which was, that we should go to the Gallies, and
there row at the oares ende ten yeeres, and then to
be brought backe to the Inquisition house, to haue the coate
with S. Andrewes crosse put on our backs, and from thence to
goe to the euerlasting prison remedilesse, and so we were
returned from the scaffold from whence we came. Thomas
Marks, and Thomas Ellis were called, and had sentence to serue
in the Galleys eight yeeres, and Humphrey Roberts, and Iohn
Emery to serue fiue yeeres, and so were returned to the benches
on the scaffold, where we sate till foure of clocke in the afternoone.
Then we were led againe to the Inquisition house, from whence
we were brought. The next day in the morning Bresinia the
treasurer came thither to vs, and deliuered to euery one of vs his
sentence in writing. I with the rest were sent to the Gallies,
where we were chained foure and foure together: euery mans
daily allowance was 26 ounces of course blacke bisket and water,
our clothing for the whole yeere two shirts, two paire of breeches
of course canuas, a red coat of course cloth, soone on, and soone
off, and a gowne of haire with a friers hood: our lodging was on
the bare boords, and banks of the Gallies, our heads and beards
were shauen euery month, hunger, thirst, cold, and stripes we
lacked none, til our seueral times expired. And after the time
of 12. yeeres, for I serued two yeeres aboue my sentence, I was
sent backe to the Inquisition House in Siuill, and there hauing
put on the coat with S. Andrewes crosse, I was sent to the euerlasting
prison remedilesse, where I wore the coat 4. yeeres, and
then vpon great suit, I had it taken off for 50 duckets, which Hernando
de Soria treasurer of the kings mint lent me, whom I
serued for it as a drudge 7. yeres, and vntil the moneth of
October last, 1590. and then I came from Siuill to S. Lucar,
where I made meanes to come away in a flie-boat, that was laden
<!--240.png-->
<span class="pagenum">243</span>
with wines and salt, which were Flemings goods, the king of
Spaines subiects, dwelling in Siuil, maried to Spanish women, and
sworne to their king. In this moneth of October last departing
from S. Lucar, at sea, off the southermost Cape, we met an
English ship, called the Galeon Dudley, who took the Flemming,
and me out of him, and brought me to Portsmouth, where they
set me on land, the 2. day of December last past, 1590. From
thence I was sent by M. Muns the lieutenant of Portsmouth,
with letters to the R. honourable the Earle of Sussex, who commanded
his secretary to take my name and examination, how
long I had bene out of England, and with whom I went, which
he did. And on Christmas euen I took my leaue of his honour,
and came to Redriffe.</p>

<p>The Computation of my imprisonment.</p>

<p>I suffered imprisonment in Mexico two yeeres.</p>

<p>In the Contratation house in Siuill one yeere.</p>

<p>In the Inquisition house in Triana one yeere.</p>

<p>I was in the Gallies twelue yeeres.</p>

<p>In the euerlasting prison remediles, with the coat with S.

<p>And at libertie I serued as a drudge Hemando de Soria 3.

<p>Since my departure from England, vntill this time of my

many perils I was in, in the Gallies.</p>

<p>First in the Port of Saint John de Vllua, where being on shore,
with many other of our company, which were all slaine sauing I,

<div class="DescrHdr2"><a name="a360" id="a360"></a>
A relation of the Hauen of Tecuanapa, a most conuenient place
for building of ships, situate vpon the South sea not farre
from Nicaragua, which was sent vnto the viceroy of Mexico
or to the king of Spaine: wherein are described the riuers
of Ometepec, Tlacamama, and Tlacolula falling into the
said Hauen, with the townes, people, and mountaines
adioyning to the said riuers, and other things fit for the
building and victualling of ships.</div>

<p>The Port and small harbour of Tecuanapa hath in the driest
time of Sommer in the chanell little lesse then one fathome at low
water, and at full sea one fathome and an halfe: in the time of
raine, with the increasing of the land-water it hath three fathoms
and more. It lyeth toward the West, and there the Bishopricks
of Guaxacan and Tlarcali are separated. From hence toward the
point called Punta de Intla and Dordaci there is a Bay 2. leagues
distant, which though it be no special harbour, yet vpon an
extremity ships may come and ride there, as in times past they
haue done. This Bay on the right hand toward the North
maketh a lake somewhat large towards the midst of the chanell,
and in some parts deepe, but specially on the side of Cuahintla,
but on either side it is but shallow. As you passe betweene the
sea and certaine great and large woods of orenge trees, and
trees of other nature which grow along the sea coast, which
are of no great bredth, al the countrey appeareth very open:
howbeit on the side of Cuahintla the mountaines haue many
creeks and a small lake called Tulaningo, and the countrey
cannot be trauelled, except you take the way betweene the sea
and the end of this lake, which may be about two leagues of
sandy way. And on the North side there is another small creeke.
And going by the sands side one quarter of a league, you come
to the way that leadeth vnto Quacapotla a mansion of Intla.</p>

<p>The riuer of Ometepec being the principal riuer which commeth
to this hauen hath his head in the mountaines of Xicayan de
Touer about 24 leagues from this hauen from diuers brooks which
come out of the mountaines of Cacatepec, and beneath a towne
called Suchistlahuaca litle more then 3. leagues all the brooks
ioyne together: and from that place you may passe downe to the
sea with Canoas and Lighters; and you might come farther but for
the fall of a furious streame or current which runeth between two
great rocks, passing from Cocahulapa a mansion of Ometepec
<!--242.png-->
<span class="pagenum">245</span>
vnto Yanguitle a mansion of the said Ometepec. These inconueniences
being past (which in my iudement may be about one
league) the Riuer is more nauigable, so that you may sayle in the
same about 12. leagues. During the space of which 12 leagues,
about a league and a halfe distance from the waters side, and in
many other parts of the same riuer it hath great quantitie of
woods which vse to grow in hot soiles, fit for ship-timber, as
Huber-trees, and Suchicuhitil, whereof they of Nicaragua make
great profit. Also there be white okes and Tehegurtes in great
quantitie, and many other kinds of timber: and in the mountaines
there be firre-trees, okes, and cork-trees, which easily may bee
caried downe the riuer, because they may be cut some 2, 3, 4,
and 5. leagues from the riuer, and may be brought downe to the
waters side with the seruice and helpe of those that dwell in the
townes thereabout.</p>

<p>At the head of these brooks where the riuer beginneth is the
towne which is called Xicaian, belonging to the heires of Francis
de Touer y de Guillen, containing about 350 Indians of rude
speech and of little policie, being 24. leagues from the sea, little
more or lesse. The place it selfe is hot, although the mountaines
round about be cold.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Aionapa.</span>
A little from this is the towne of Aioanapa possessed
by the heirs of Perez Gomez, hauing in it
about 300. Indians of the selfe same speach and qualitie. The
countrey is more subiect to heate then cold; yet hath it neere it
cold countrey and mountaines. It is distant from Xicaian de
Touer 4. leagues, and from the sea 20. leagues.</p>

<p>Sixe leagues downeward toward the South is the towne of
Suchistlahuaca on the said riuer, and the inhabitants are of the
same speach and qualities. The countrey is more subiect to
heate then cold. It is in the charge of Gonzaluo Fernandez a
citizen of Mexico, and hath about 150. Indians, and is 15. leagues
distant from the sea.</p>

<p>From this towne vnto the towne of Ometepec are 6 leagues.
The place is very hot, and in the same gouernment, and is
situate betweene certaine hils one league from the riuer: he and
his followers haue vnder them about 700. Indians, which speake
the Ayacastecan, Amusgan, and Niciecan tongues, and this place
is from the sea nine leagues.</p>

<p>From this towne vnto Ihualapa are two great leagues: it is in
the gouernment of the heires of Laurence de Castro, of the foresaid
<!--243.png-->
<span class="pagenum">246</span>
temperature, and the people vse the said language, and are
of the like stature: and it standeth three leagues from the riuer,
and from the sea ten leagues.</p>

<p>These are the best townes, and of the best traffique that are
vpon all this coast. The Indians are rich in Cacao and victuals,
and in these townes doe the Indians of Niciecan principally trade.
And in the towns of Ihualapa the chiefe Aguazil of the prouince
is resident for the most part of the yeere.</p>

<p>More lowe beneath the riuer of Tlacolula, about a league or a
league and an halfe from the towne of Ometepec is the towne
called Pio, which was wont to be a towne of Tlacolula, and was a
frontier towne against the Mexicans. There be in it about 50.
Indians of the ancient inhabitants: one Grauiel de Chiauez a
citizen of Mexico hath the gouernement thereof: it is 4. leagues
from Ihualapa, and 6. from the sea.</p>

<p>A little below this is the towne of Huehuatlan in the selfe
same gouernement standing one league from the riuer on
certaine high hils: it hath 10. Indians, and is from the sea 5.
leagues.</p>

<p>And one league from this towne stands the towne of Cuahacapotla
a mansion of Antla or Intla: it hath to the number of 15.
Indians; it standeth one league and a halfe from the riuer, and
4. leagues, from the mouth thereof.</p>

<p>At the fountaines or heads of the rest of the brooks is the
towne of Cacatepec being in the gouernment of Raphael de
Treyo: he and his tenants haue vnder them some 700. Indians of
Niciecan: it is from the sea some 22. leagues.</p>

<p>The riuer which is called Tlacamama commeth from the
mountains of Atoyaque and Amusgos, which are some 17. leagues
from the sea. There it maketh a formed riuer, so big, that it is
nauigable to the sea with canoas and lighters: I say from a litle
below Tolistlahuaca a mansion of Xicaian. It is nauigable 8
moneths in the yeere, and the other 4. not, because that the sands
of the plaines do soke and drink vp the water in such wise, that
there remaineth so little, that there is no passage: howbeit in
small lighters timber may bee brought downe this riuer one
league from the place where it is cut, vnto the place that I haue
spoken of; whereas bigger vessels may bee made; for nigh vnto
that place other brooks and running waters doe ioyne and meet,
which make it a maine riuer. It hath nigh vnto it in the mountaines
of Atoyaque, Cacatepec, and Amusgos many woods of
<!--244.png-->
<span class="pagenum">247</span>
pine-trees, cork-trees, and okes of great bignesse: and beneath
those mountaines in the warme countrey, neere vnto the riuers
there is much timber of those sorts which I mentioned before to
be about the riuer of Ometepec, which may easily be cut and
carried downe vnto Tecuanapa in the time before specified.</p>

<p>This riuer hath likewise townes adioyning to it; the first at the
foote of the mountaines is the town of Atoiaque belonging to the
king, and to the heires of Pronetto: their language is Niciecan,
the countrey hot, the people politique, and it is from the sea 15.
leagues. It hath about 200. Indians.</p>

<p>One league from this towne, and 14. from the sea is the towne
of Xicaian belonging likewise to the king, and to the heires of
Pronetto. They are Niciecan people and very comely, and in a
hot countrey. It hath by account 300. Indians. There are
resident in it the Vicar and Iustice; it is from the riuer a league
and a halfe.</p>

<p>A league from this towne, and 14. from the sea is situate the
mansion of Pinotespan subiect to Tututepec, which hath with the
manors subject vnto it 500. Indians.</p>

<p>Two leagues from the towne, and one from Xicayan, and 13.
from Tecuanapa, and 3. from the riuer is the towne of Tlacamama:
the people are very comely, and politique. It containeth some
100. Indians, and belongeth to the king.</p>

<p>More toward the South 5. leagues from the riuer, and two from
this towne, and 14. from the sea is the towne called Pinotespan
del Rey: They are handsome people, but of slow speach: this
towne conteineth about 100. Indians like the former. They be
wealthie, because they make great quantitie of salte; for they
haue a lake in which salte groweth vnder the water, (a thing
repugnant to nature, that two contraries doe grow and are conserued
together) whereout they take it in breaking it with stones
vpon the ground vnder the water.</p>

<p>It hath also the towne of Amusgos, which is in the gouernment
of Fernando de Auila, which may be from Tecuanapa 18. leagues.
They speake the Amusgan tongue. The countrey is hotte: it
standeth on the highway from Nicieca: it hath 400. Indians, few
more or lesse.</p>

<p>These are all the townes of account situate neere this riuer.</p>

<p>Neere vpon this riuer are two farmes, the one belonging to
Pedro Brauo, and the other to him that maketh this relation vnto
your Excellencie, which may be from the sea some 8. or 9.
<!--245.png-->
<span class="pagenum">248</span>
leagues all plaine ground. And in this territorie there is but one
towne called Quesala situate vpon the riuer, and 6. leagues from
the sea; which in times past hath beene a great towne, and
now hath but three Indians onely, and it is from the farmes
3. leagues.</p>

<p>The mansion house of Don Mattheo is more toward the South,
standing in a mountainous and waste countrey, which aboundeth
with cattell being 3. leagues from the riuer; and as farre from
Tecuanapa, as from the place where all the cattel is; and the
sea that way is from it but one league.</p>

<p>A little below this mansion about 4. leagues, and 7. leagues
from the sea, is a garden of Alonso Pedraza which beareth Cacao.</p>

<p>And 2. leagues from this garden, and 6. leagues from the sea
standeth the towne of Cuahintlan belonging to the king a towne
of 19 housholds, but very rich, for they gather much Cacao
and the best in that countrey. They speake the Tlapanecan
tongue. This towne hath the sea that way within halfe a
league.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Huatulco or Guatulco in 15. deg and 50.
minutes.</span>
And this coast from Cuahintlan to Tecuanapa, and
the coast which runneth to Huatulco is a coast of
much pearle, for in olde time the Indians gathered
much pearle there.</p>

<p>And 2 leagues from Cuahintlan and 4. from Tecuanapa is a
garden of Cacao in the landes of Francisco Maldonado, which is
called Cacahu-Atoyaque.</p>

<p>These are the things worthy of relation from the head springs
of this riuer of Tlacamama vnto the sea: and this foresaid riuer
entreth into the riuer of Ometepec 5. leagues from Tecuanapa.</p>

<p>The riuer of Tlacolula springeth within the boundes of Chilsiztlahuaca
subiect to Comastlahuaca a towne of Suchistlahuaca,
neere which are many mountaines. This riuer is nauigable little
more then 2. leagues before it entreth into the riuer of Ometepec,
where it is 5. leagues from the sea.</p>

<p>Hard by it is the towne of Tlacolula abouenamed; and 3.
leagues from it is the towne of Azoyoque an olde manour of
Tlapa. The towne of Chilsiztlahuaca hath but 3. Indians; and
the towne of Azoyoque hath more then 300. Indians. But because
in this hauen must bee the building of ships, the prouince
of Talpa and Tututepec may stand them in great stead; the
prouince of Tututepec being neighbour to the riuer of Tlacamama,
and the prouince of Tlapa to the riuer of Tlacolula.
<!--246.png-->
<span class="pagenum">249</span>
For they may, as I haue sayd, carrie the timber in lighters or
rafts downe the riuers, and may vse the Indians in the townes
thereabout to fell and draw the same out of the cold mountaines;
for in the warm countreys the most is plaine ground, whereas
with very fewe men and oxen it may be brought vnto the place
where it should be imbarqued.</p>

<p>There may come flat bottomes, and canoas vnto the townes
thereabout, and lade themselues with victuals: For they haue
already come by that riuer to the rode of Ometepec, and made
there prouision at the mansion of Don Mattheo, and at the
farmes, at that time when his Maiestie did people the
plaines which are betweene these riuers, conteining a large and
voyde countrey sufficient for the erecting of 20. manours, being a
countrey well furnished with water and pasture without any
danger or perill, according to the description hereunto annexed.</p>

<p>This small harbour of Tecuanapa being seene and viewed,
seemeth very commodious to build shippes in, by reason of the
great abundance of mountaines full of good timber for that purpose,
with the commodities of riuers, and with the seruice and
victuals from the townes thereabout, which be very good for coast
townes.</p>

<p>The desire of him that made this relations, hath bene with
zeale to serue your excellencie; who therewithall desireth the
Lord God to giue the successe.</p>

A briefe relation of two sundry voyages made by the worshipful
M. William Haukins of Plimmouth, father to Sir Iohn
Haukins knight, late Treasurer of her Majesties Nauie, in
the yeere 1530 and 1532.</div>

<p>Olde M. William Haukins of Plimmouth, a man for his wisedome,
valure, experience, and skill in sea causes much esteemed,
and beloued of K. Henry the 8, and being one of the principall
Sea-captaines in the West parts of England in his time, not
contented with the short voyages commonly then made onely to
the knowne coasts of Europe, armed out a tall and goodly shippe
of his owne of the burthen of 250 tunnes called the Paule of
Plimmouth, wherewith he made three long and famous voyages
vnto the coast of Brasil, a thing in those dayes very rare,
especially to our Nation. In the course of which voyages he
touched at the riuer of Sestos vpon the coast of Guinea, where
hee traffiqued with the Negros, and tooke of them Elephants
teeth, and other commodities which that place yeeldeth: and so
<!--248.png-->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
arriuing on the coast of Brasil, he vsed there such discretion,
and behaued himselfe so wisely with those sauage people, that
he grew into great familiarity and friendship with them.
<span class="sidenote">A king of Brasil brought into England.</span>
Insomuch
that in his second voyage, one of the sauage
kings of the countrey of Brasil, was contented to
take ship with him, and to be transported hither into
England: whereunto M. Haukins agreed, leauing
behinde in the Countrey as a pledge for his saftie
and returne againe, one Martin Cockeram of Plimmouth. This
Brasilian king being arrived, was brought vp to London and
presented to K. Henry the 8, lying as then at White-hall: at the
sight of whom the King and all the Nobilitie did not a litle
maruaile, and not without cause: for in his cheekes were holes
made according to their sauage maner, and therein smalle bones
were planted, standing an inch out from the said holes, which in
his owne Countrey was reputed for a great brauerie. He had
also another hole in his nether lip wherein was set a precious
stone about the bignes of a pease: All his apparel, behauiour,
and gesture, were very strange to the beholders.</p>

<p>Hauing remained here the space almost of a whole yeere, and
the king with his sight fully satisfied, M. Hawkins according to
his promise and appointment, purposed to conuey him againe
into his countrey: but it fell out in the way, that by change of
aire and alteration of diet, the said Sauage King died at sea,
which was feared would turn to the losse of the life of Martin
Cockeram his pledge. Neuerthelesse, the Sauages being fully
perswaded of the honest dealing of our men with their prince,
restored againe the said pledge, without any harme to him, or
any man of the company: which pledge of theirs they brought
home againe into England, with their ship fraighted, and furnished
with the commodities of the countrey. Which Martin
Cockeram, by the witnesse of Sir Iohn Hawkins, being an officer
in the towne of Plimmouth, was liuing within these fewe yeeres.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a>
This Martin Cockeram is introduced by Kingsley in Chapter XXX of
"Westward Ho!" Indeed the principal incidents of that novel are nothing
but extracts from Hakluyt's Collection; in many passages, the only difference
being the use of modern phraseology.</div>

A letter written to M. Richard Staper by Iohn Whithal from
Santos in Brasil, the 26. of Iune 1578.</div>

<p>Worshipfull sir, and welbeloued friend M. Staper, I haue me
most heartily commended vnto you, wishing your health euen as
mine owne.</p>

<p>These few words may bee to let you vnderstand, that whereas
I wrote vnto you not many dayes past by the way of Lisbon,
howe that I determined to bee with you very shortly, it is in this
countrey offered mee to marry, and to take my choice of three or
foure: so that I am about three dayes agoe consorted with an
Italian gentleman to marry with his daughter within these foure
dayes. This my friend and father in law Signor Ioffo Dore is
borne in the citie of Geneua in Italy:
<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
his kindred is well knowen
amongst the Italians in London: also hee hath but onely this
childe which is his daughter, which hee hath thought better
bestowed vpon mee then on any Portugal in all the countrey, and
doeth giue with her in marriage to me part of an Ingenio which
<!--250.png-->
<span class="pagenum">253</span>
he hath, that doeth make euery yeere a thousand roues of sugar.
This my mariage will be worth to me two thousand duckets,
little more or lesse. Also Signor Ioffo Dore my father in law
doeth intende to put into my handes the whole Ingenio with
sixtie or seuentie slaues, and thereof to make me factor for vs
both. I giue my liuing Lord thankes for placing me in such
honour and plentifulnesse of all things.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a>
Of course this it intended for Genoa.</div>

<p>Also certaine dayes past I talked with the Prouedor and the
Captaine, and they haue certified me, that they haue
discouered certaine Mines of siluer and gold, and
looke euery day for Masters to come to open the
said Mines: which when they be opened will inrich
this countrey very much.
<span class="sidenote">Mines of gold and siluer newly discouered at S.
Vincent.</span>
This place is called S.
Vincent, and is distant from you two thousand leagues, and in
24. degrees of latitude on the South side of the Equinoctial line,
and almost vnder the Tropike of Capricorne. A countrey it is
very healthful without sicknesse.</p>

<p>Moreouer, I haue talked with the Captaine and Prouedor, and
my father in law, who rule all this countrey, for to haue a ship
with goods to come from London hither, which haue promised
mee to giue mee licence, saying that nowe I am free denizen of
this countrey. To cause a ship to come hither with such
commodities as would serue this countrey, would come to great
gaines, God sending in safety the profite and gaines. In such
wares and commodities as you may ship hither from
London is for euery one commoditie deliuered here
three for one, and then after the proceed may be
imployed in white sugar at foure hundred reis the
roue.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The voyage to S. Vincent worth three for one
outward only.</span>
I meane also to haue a friend in London to send mee a ship of
60. or 70. tunnes, little more or lesse, with such commodities as I
shall giue aduise for. This voyage is as good as any Peru-voyage.
If you and Master Osborne will deale here, I will deale with you
before any other, because of our old friendly friendship in time
past. If you haue any stomacke thereto, in the name of God do
you espie out a fine barke of seuentie or eightie tunnes, and send
her hither with a Portugall Pilot to this port of S. Vincent in
Brasil, bordering vpon the borders of Peru.</p>

<p>Also I herewith write vnto you in what forme and maner you
shall furnish this voyage both in commodities and otherwise.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">In what maner a voyage to S. Vincent with a ship of
70. or 80. tunnes is to be made.</span>

Cordouan skinnes of these colours, to wit, orenge,
tawnie, yellow, red, and very fine black. I thinke
you shall not finde such colours there. Therefore you must cause
them that shall goe vpon this voyage, to take saffron with them,
to cause the same skinnes to bee put into the saide colours. Also
I thinke you shall finde oyles there. Three hogsheads of sweete
oyle for this voyage are very necessary, or a hundred and fiftie
iarres of oyle. Also in London you may lade in the said ship
these parcels of commodities or wares, as followeth:</p>

by the helpe of God I shall put all things in good order according

Captaine and Prouedor doe rule this countrey.</p>

<p>My father in law and I shal (God willing) make a good

<p>Here in this countrey in stead of Iohn Whithall they haue

to come directly hither to the port of S. Vincent, and from the

<p>Also a dozen shirts for my wearing let be sent, if you send the
ship.</p>

which is the most necessary thing that can be sent.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2"><a name="a399" id="a399"></a>A copie of the letters of the Aduenturers for Brasill sent to Iohn
Whithall dwelling in Santos, by the Minion of London,
Anno 1580. the 24. of October in London.</div>

<p>Master Whithall, as vnacquainted wee commend vs vnto you,
etc. vnderstanding by your friends, M. Iohn Bird, M. Robert
Walkaden, and your brother Iames Whithall of certaine letters
that they haue receiued of yours from Santos, which wee haue
seene and read, wherein from time to time you doe require, and
desire them to send a good ship to Santos, with such wares and
commodities as you did write for, whereby you did not onely
promise that they should haue good intertainment, but also
should sell the saide commodities to make three of one outward
at the least in euery thing, and that for to relade their ship backe,
they should haue of the best, finest, and whitest drie sugars 32.
pound of our weight for a ducket at the most. The premises
considered, with the great credit that they and we doe giue to
your writing and promise, haue caused vs, whose names be hereunder
written, to ioyne our selues in company together, and to
be at great charges purposely to send this good ship the Minion
of London, not onely with such marchandizes as you wrote for,
but also with as many other things as we thought might any
wayes pleasure you, or profit the country. And we craue of you,
that we and our factors may haue so much credite of you, as we
haue in you and of your letters, which is to beleeue vs that we
<!--254.png-->
<span class="pagenum">257</span>
haue taken this voyage vpon vs, with no other minde or purpose,
then to deale faithfully and truely in the trade by sea and land,
so as you shall not onely haue cause to reioyce, and deserue
thanks for our comming, but also you wil procure the magistrates
there to be bound, as they vse in Galicia, that we may be preserued
and defended from all reprisals and imbargements of
princes or subiects for any causes or matters whatsoeuer, whereby
wee may bee incouraged by them, giuing vs this securitie of good
intertainment, to continue the trade yeerely henceforth: and for
our parts we promise upon our credits and fidelities, to commit
no outrage at the sea nor land, nor suffer any to be done in our
company that we may let, but rather to defend and protect all
other such peaceable marchants as we are, with their ships
and goods.</p>

<p>And to the ende that you and others shall know that wee
meane as we say, we haue giuen order to our factors to giue you
good hostages for your assurance of our good fidelities: and
further we haue sent a testimoniall of our owne true meaning in
writing vnder the seales of this honourable Citie of London,
which we wil not discredite by our behauiours for all the treasure
that you haue: and so we haue written to your magistrates of
your port, and others in Spanish, the copy whereof we send you
herewith enclosed in English. And if the time should fal out so
contrary to our expectations, that there should not be fine white
sugar sufficient to lade our ship in due time at Santos, then we
pray you direct our factours where they may goe with the shippe
in safetie to supply their want, and helpe them to a good sure
Pilot for that purpose, and write your letters to your friends
where the best sugar is made in their fauors, and helpe our
factours to haue a testimoniall from Santos, that they and you
traded together friendly, and so departed in good and perfect
amitie, and shew them that the iust cause of our comming is to
trade as marchants peaceably, and not as Pirates to commit any
offence to one or other.</p>

<p>Also we pray you, if there be any store of waxe, or salt-peeter,
whereby the price there may yeeld vs as much profit as the white
sugars at a ducket the roue, or any other commodity of like
profite, then to procure that we may lade it without danger of
lawe, be it oare of golde or siluer or whatsoeuer else.</p>

<p>We haue sent you copper cauldrons for your Ingenios, with
iron and all other necessaries for your purpose, and artificers to
<!--255.png-->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
set the same: and as wee haue at your request bene at great
charges in sending these men, so we pray you let vs haue lawful
fauour in like courtesie to further all our causes. And if any of
our Mariners or passengers in any respect of displeasure against
their company, or in hope of preferment of mariage or otherwise
would procure to tary and dwell there, and leaue his charge and
office, that then you will bee a meane to the Iustice that such
fugitives should be sent abord the ship as prisoners: for as you
know, without our men wee cannot bring home our ship.</p>

<p>Wee haue giuen order to our factours to vse your counsell and
helpe in their affaires, and to gratifie you for the same as to your
courtesie and faithfull friendship shall appertaine to your good
liking: and in the meane time for a token of our good willes
towards you, we haue sent you a fieldbed of walnut tree, with the
canopy, valens, curtaines, and gilt knops. And if there be any
commoditie else that may pleasure you or your friends, wee haue
giuen order that they shall haue the refusing of it before any
other, giuing for it as it is worth.</p>

<p>And thus to conclude, promising to performe all the foresaide
things on our parts in euery condition, we commit you to God,
who euer preserue you with all his blessings.</p>

Certaine notes of the voyage to Brasil with the Minion of London
aforesaid, in the yere 1580. written by Thomas Grigs
Purser of the said ship.</div>

<p>The thirde day of Nouember in the yeere abouesaid we
departed in the Minion of London from Harwich, from which
time no great thing worth the knowledge or regard of others
happened vntil the 22. of December the next moneth, which day
for our owne learning and vse wee obserued the setting of the
Sunne, which was West southwest, we then being vnder the line
Equinoctiall, where we found the aire very temperate, and the
<!--256.png-->
<span class="pagenum">259</span>
winde for the most part Southeast and East southeast. The
same day we also obserued the rising of the moone, being one
day after the full, which rose at East northeast.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The first land that wee fell with vpon the coast of Brasill was
the yland of S. Sebastian, where we arriued the 14. day of Ianuary
in the yeere 1581.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

South West of Rio de Janeiro.</div>

<p>The 16. day Thomas Babington, and others in our pinnesse,
went a shoare to Guaybea, where they met with Iohn Whithall
his father and mother in lawe, who hauing receiued letters from
thence to be deliuered at Santos, came abord, and then we weyed
and set saile, and the 28. day wee arriued at the yland of Santa
Catelina, neere the entrance of Santos.</p>

<p>Our course from S. Sebastian was Southwest and by West, and
betwixt the Southwest and by West, and West southwest.</p>

<p>This yland of Santa Catelina seemeth at the first to be a part
of the yland of Girybia. Wee ankered at nine fathome blacke
osie ground.</p>

<p>Vpon the yland there grow many Palmito-trees, but no fresh
water is there to be found.</p>

<p>The third day of February we arriued before the towne of
Santos, and were there well received and intertained of the
Captaine, the kings officers, and all the people.</p>

<p>The fourth day we tooke into our ship a beefe aliue, which
for the victualling of the ship, and the refreshing of our men, and
to make vs the merrier at Shrouetide.</p>

<p>The eight day we deliuered to M. Iohn Whithall a bedstead
with the appurtenances, which were sent to him from our
marchants of London.</p>

<p>The 18. day the captaine of Santos came abord our ship, by
whom we had knowledge of foure great French ships of warre,
that had bene at the riuer of Ienero, which there tooke three
Canoas, but were driuen from thence by their castles and forts,
and were looked for here at Santos. Whereupon the Captaine
requested vs to lend them some armour and artillery, and we
lent them twentie caliuers and two barrels of powder.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The yle of Alcatrarzas or Pelicanes.</span>
The 19. day our skiffe which we had sent to
Alcatrarzas, and had bene away sixe dayes, came
againe, and brought good store of great and good
fish, and tolde vs that there was good store of fish to be taken
<!--257.png-->
<span class="pagenum">260</span>
there by the hooke, and as much wood as we would haue of
the Palmito-tree.</p>

<p>The 20. day at night Nicholas Gale, one of our company, fell
ouer our shippes side, and was drowned in the port of Santos
before the towne, where our ship rode at anker.</p>

<p>The 22. day two of the Canoas which the Frenchmen tooke in
the riuer of Ienero, returned to Santos, and reported that the
foure French ships were past to the southwards, as they thought,
for the Straights of Magellan, and so into the South sea.</p>

<p>The 23. day the aforesaid Nicholas Gale, who fell ouerboard
two days before, was found againe, and taken vp three miles from
our ship, and our company went to his buriall in the Church at
Santos.</p>

<p>This day the Captaine and Iustices of Santos wished vs to
tary in their road till the last of April, for they had sent a barke
of Santos to Baya at the kings charges, to know whether we
should haue trade there or no, and this barke could not returne
before that time.</p>

<p>About this time there arriued at Fernambuck
<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> a shippe from
Portugall, which brought newes that the Islands, Indies, and
Portugall it selfe was molested and troubled by the Spaniards,
and that the Portugales had both English and Frenchmen to
Lisbone to defend them against Spaine.</p>

<p>The 25. day wee sent two of our men, namely Thomas
Michael and Simon Thorne to Baya in a barke that went thither
from Santos.</p>

<p>The two and twentie day of April our Master and Thomas
Babington hauing some talke and conference with the Padres
of Santos, they (our men being ready to go to the Riuer of
Ienero) tolde them, that they were sorry for our banishment from
the Church, and that the Ministrador had written from Rio de
Ienero, that forasmuch as these twentie yeres or more the English
nation had denied the Church of Rome and her proceedings, therefore
the Ministrador commanded that none of vs should come to
their Church: the Padres willed vs herein to haue patience, and
to take it in good part, and promised to stand our friends in their
word and writing, both to the Ministrador and to the bishop at
Baya, and further requested all our English company to haue no
ill opinion of them.</p>

<p><!--[258.png]--><span class="pagenum">261</span></p>

<p>The 28. of April we laded sugars into our ship.</p>

<p>The 21. of May we tooke in fresh victuals from Santos.</p>

<p>The 10. day of Iune we gratified one Iosto Thorno, dwelling
in Santos, with some of our English victuals, and intertained him
in good sort in our ship, and this day wee were promised to
haue a Pilot at Santos to cary vs to Baya.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Leaks in the Minion made by wormes.</span>
The 11. day we went to fish, to make prouision for our ship

and cut wood for our fire, and trimmed our ship of the harmes
and leakes which the wormes had made in her while
wee ridde at the yland of S. Sebastian, and in the
meane time we departed from before the towne of
Santos. Our Master sent his skiffe from the barre of Santos,
thinking to haue brought Thomas Babington and William Euet
with the Pilot, which wee had tarried for three dayes: and as
the skiffe was going, William Euet being by the Riuers side,
called to our pinnesse, and sent a letter to our
Master, <span class="sidenote"> Whose name was Stephen Hare.</span> which
Thomas Babington had written,
wherein were no newes, but that the Ministrador was
arriued at Santos from the Riuer of Ienero, and would speake with
our Master, but he willed that whatsoeuer Thomas Babington did
write, no credit should be giuen to it. And further he wished
vs presently to depart for Sant Sebastian, and there to dispatch
our businesse, and then to sende backe for Babington and himselfe
to Guaybea, where he (if he were well) would giue his
attendance to come abord.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Their departure from Santos.</span>
As we rid two leagues a sea-bord the barre of
Santos, wee broke a cable in the open sea, which
happened the 15. day of this moneth.</p>

<p>We arriued at S. Sebastian the 15. day, and there shifted our
balast, and had in stones, and halled our ship a ground to stop
our leakes, and caried our casks a shoare to be hooped for
water, which indeed might better haue bene done in Santos, before
the Ministrador came thither: yet we finished all things
pertaining to our ship, by the 22 of this moneth, at S. Sebastian.</p>

<p>The first day of Iuly Thomas Babington came abord with
William Euet, in our pinnesse, and the rest of our men that went
for them: but there was no Pilot brought according to promise
to cary vs to Baya.</p>

<p>The things that we obserued and noted in the time of our
being at Santos, were these.</p>

<p><!--259.png--><span class="pagenum">262</span></p>

<p>All such wares and marchandizes as owe no custome in
Brasill, their vse is, to set a price vpon the same, how they
shalbe sold: which is done by the magistrates of the towne,
according to the ordinances of their King.</p>

<p>But for all such marchandizes as do owe custome there, the
marchants are to sell them according as they may, to the greatest
profit and aduantage that they can.</p>

<p>Concerning the prouince of Peru, wee learned that one part
of it by land and water is but twelue dayes iourney from the
towne of Santos, and from thence it may be about foure or fiue
dayes iourney by water to the maine riuer of Plate.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>From the head of the riuer of Plate, and from their chiefe
townes there, they do trade and trafique by land into Peru by
waggons, and horses or mules.</p>

<p>The said riuer of Plate is so full of sands and dangers, and
the fresh so fierce sometimes, that no shipping dares to deale
with it, small barks to their knowledge may go vp it, and not els.</p>

<p>The Portugales here cannot be suffered to vse their Mines of
treasure in these parts, vpon paine of death, the contrary being
commanded by the king and the Vice-roy, who is as their king
in place of authoritie.</p>

<p>About twentie leagues from Santos there is a certaine kinde of
wilde Sauages, lying in the mountaines, which are in friendship
with the Portugales, and they haue continuall warres with certaine
other Sauages that dwell towards the borders of Peru, which is
distant from Santos about 400. or 500. leagues. Those Sauages
of Peru haue store of gold and siluer, but they knowe not the
vse of it.</p>

<p>Looke what Sauages of their enemies they take, they sell them
to the Portugales for kniues, combes, axes or hatchets, and other
trifles: they will sell one for a pennie-knife to a Portugal, and
after two yeeres they are worth twentie or thirtie duckets to the
Portugal.</p>

<p>This people haue also continuall warres with the Spaniards:
and this was tolde vs by one of those Sauages, which hath dwelt
among the Portugales these seuen yeeres, with his master called
Sennor Manoel Veloso. And this fellowe would willingly haue
come with vs for England.</p>

Paraguay is probably meant. The river of that name, which ultimately
flows into the Sea as Rio de la Plata, is about 700 miles distant from Santos.</div>

There are certaine rockes that lie off betweene the yle of

faire weather shewe like the sailes of ships.</p>

<p>There are other rocks that lie off S. Catelina also

<p>At our comming vp to Santos we found foure fadom and a

A letter of Francis Suares to his brother Diego Suares dwelling
in Lisbon, written from the riuer of Ienero in Brasill in
Iune 1596. concerning the exceeding rich trade newly
begunne betweene that place and Peru, by the way of
the Riuer of Plate, with small barks of 30. and 40. tunnes.</div>

<p>Sir, we set saile from Lisbon the fourth of April 1596. and
arriued here in this riuer of Ienero the twentie seuenth of Iune
next ensuing. And the same day the Visitadores did visit our
ship with great ioy, thinking that those commodities which wee
brought with vs, had bene for the marchants of this countrey:
but it prooued to the contrary.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Wine solde at an excessiue rate.</span>
The pilot brought with him in the sayd shippe two pipes of
wine which were taken from him, and solde by the Iustice for
foure and twenty reals euery gallon. But I solde
mine for two and thirty and sixe and thirty reals the
gallon. If I had brought any great store of wine, I
should haue made a great gaine of it: for I should haue gotten
eight reals for one.</p>

<p>The next day in the morning we went all on shore, and gaue
God thanks for our prosperous voyage, and good successe which
he had sent vs. And because the gouernour of this countrey was
gone from this Towne to another house of his, three leagues vp
into the riuer beyond the place where we rode at anker, I desired
the captaine of our shippe after dinner, that we might take the
<!--261.png-->
<span class="pagenum">264</span>
shippe boat, and goe to the place where the gouernour did lie.
And so going vp the riuer, we met with a canoa which was
comming downe the riuer, and going aboard our shippe; which
canoa was laden with fresh victuals, and in the same was one
Portugall, which met vs, and tolde vs that the gouernour of that
captaine shippe had sent vs a present, which we receiued very
thankefully, and sent it aboord. And we went vp the riuer, to
the place where the gouernour did dwell; and comming to the
place where we landed, hard by the riuers side, the gouernour
came thither and receiued vs very courteously. So we remained
at his house two days, talking of many matters of Portugall: then
we departed from him, and came downe the riuer.</p>

<p>Three dayes after, I hired a ware-house by my selfe, and landed
my commodities. And now I am selling them as fast as I can;
and sell them very well, and to great profit: for I haue sold all
our hats. I would I had brought forty or fifty dozen, by reason
of the great vtterance of them vp into Peru, and into the new
kingdome of Granada, by the way of the riuer of
Plate.
<span class="sidenote">A rich trade from the riuer of Ienero by the riuer
of Plate into Peru, etc.</span>
For here is passage euery three or foure
moneths with barks of thirty and forty tunnes a piece,
which are laden with sugars, rice, taffataes, hats, and
other kindes of commodities of this countrey, which
are caried vp the sayd riuer of Plate in the sayd barks,
and thence are conueyed vp into Peru. And these barks are but
tenne or twelue days going vp the sayd riuer to Peru. And
within foure and fiue moneths after, the sayd barkes
come downe this riuer againe laden with reals of
plate, and bring downe from those places no other
commodities but treasure.
<span class="sidenote">The shortnesse of the returne of the voyage to
Peru.</span>
It is a woonderfull thing
to behold the great gaine and profit which is gotten in
this riuer and in this countrey. I am ashamed to write it, fearing
that I shall not be beleeued. For the imployment of one hundred
ducats in spaine, being brought hither, will yeeld twelue hundred
and fifteene hundred ducats profit. This trade hath beene vsed
but within this yeere.
<span class="sidenote">The rich trade was begunne in the yere

the easier to go to Peru. For the Peruleros or merchants of Peru,
which dwell there, come downe to this harbour and riuer of
Ienero, and bring with them fifteene thousand and twentie
thousand ducats in reals of plate and gold, and imploy it heere in
this riuer in commodities: and when heere are no commodities
to be had for money in this place, then these merchants of Peru,
are constrained to go to Baia and Fernambuc, and there to imploy
their money.
<span class="sidenote">The voyage of Angola in Africa.</span>
I would I had brought good store of
silks, and not these kinde of commodities which I did
bring. For here is more profit to be had a great deale
then in the voyage of Angola. For heere with fiue hundred
ducats in fiue moneths space a man may get sixe thousand ducats.
And this is no fable, but most true, and a great deale more then I
can expresse. For a rapier Which doeth cost in Spaine foure and
twenty and sixe and twenty reals, is sold heere for forty and fifty
ducats: a bridle for a horse is solde for fifteene ducats; a lock of
a doore and the key is solde for ten ducats: a pound of beniamin
is solde for fifteene ducats: a yard of veluet is solde for twenty
and fiue and twenty ducats: taffataes are solde for sixe and seuen
ducats the vare: an ownce of muske, is solde for forty ducats:
and all kinde of commodities after this rate.
<span class="sidenote">Gaine of ten thousand ducats for the laying out of

So one
thousand ducats of Spanish commodities will gaine
tenne thousand ducats. Thus I hope in God to make
more profit and gaine this voyage, then in two voyages
to Angola: for I haue solde most of my hats for two
duckets and a halfe and for three ducats. The rest I
will cary to Angola, to helpe to sell the rest of my commodities,
which I cannot sell in this riuer. And I haue solde an hundred
cubits of broad cloth for fiue hundred and fiue hundred and fifty
and sixe hundred reys the cubit.
<span class="sidenote">A trade of buying Negros in Angola.</span>
If I would haue solde all my
cloth for ready money tolde downe for foure hundred and fifty
and fiue hundred reyes, the merchants would haue bought it all
of me: but I would sell no more, because I meant to
exchange it in Angola for Negros. Howbeit with
ready money in hand in Angola a man shall buy
better Negros, and better cheape. The captaine of
our ship solde all his cloth for ready money for fore hundred
and fifty reys the cubit, and thought that he had made a good
market, but he hath deceiued himselfe. I solde six broad clothes
for fiue hundred and fifty reys the cubit: and I was offered
<!--263.png-->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
thirty thousand reys for a cloth. Vineger is solde for two and
thirty, sixe and thirty, and forty reals a iarre, by reason
there is great store of limmons and orenges in the countrey: but
in Angola it is more woorth. Oliues are solde for halfe a reall
a piece: wherefore I hope to sell the hogshead for twenty
thousand reys. In taffataes and veluets there will
be gotten two hundred and fifty and three hundred for one
hundred. If I had brought great store, I could haue solde it all
at this rate. I haue already gotten great store of reals of plate:
for it is tolde mee that money is a good commodity in Angola.
But I must imploy some in meale, which is in the grinding. All
the rest of my money I will send you by billes of exchange, and
some part I wil imploy in sugars: for I haue sent order to Baia
for that purpose. For from this place there is no shipping that
doth go that way. So these letters I do send by the way of
Fernambuc, and haue directed them to my cousin: for I do determine
to settle my selfe here in this countrey. There is come
downe from Peru, by this riuer of Plate, a merchant called
Alonso Ramires, and he hath brought downe with him ten or
twelue thousand ducats in reals of plate, and is come downe to
this place to build him a ship to returne into Spaine; and there
is come in his company a bishop. And thus Iesus Christ send you
long health.</p>

The well gouerned and prosperous voyage of M. Iames
Lancaster, begun with three ships and a galley-frigat
from London in October 1594, and intended for Fernambuck,
the porte-towne of Olinda in Brasil. In which
voyage (besides the taking of nine and twenty ships and
frigats) he surprized the sayd port-towne, being strongly
fortified and manned; and held possession thereof thirty
dayes together (notwithstanding many bolde assaults of
the enemy both by land and water) and also prouidently
defeated their dangerous and almost ineuitable fireworks.
Heere he found the cargazon or freight of a rich East
Indian carack; which together with great abundance of
sugars, Brasil-wood, and cotton he brought from thence;
lading therewith fifteene sailes of tall ships and barks.</div>

<p>In September 1594 the worshipfull M. Iohn Wats, alderman,
<!--264.png-->
<span class="pagenum">267</span>
M. Paul Banning, alderman, and others of worship in the city of
London, victualled three good ships; to wit, The Consent, of
the burden of 240 tunnes or thereabout, The Salomon, of 170
tunnes, and the Virgin, of 60 tunnes: and appointed for commanders
in this voyage, M. Iames Lancaster of London, gentleman,
admirall of the fleet, M. Edmund Barker of London,
viceadmirall, and M. Iohn Audely of Poplar neere London
rereadmirall, hauing in their sayd ships to the number of 275
men and boyes.</p>

<p>Being fully furnished with all needfull prouision, wee departed
from Blackwall in October following, keeping our owne coast,
vntill we came into the West countrey, where we met with such
gusts and stormes, that the Salomon spending her mast at the
Range of Dartmouth, put into harbour; but by the earnest care
and industry of the generall and others hauing charge, she was
shortly againe prouided. Which done, hauing a pleasant gale
for our purpose, we put foorth from Dartmouth the last of
Nouember following. But contrary to our expectation, not fifty
leagues from our owne coast, we lost the Salomon and the
Virgin, by a storme of contrary winde that fell vpon vs: yet
being alone, in hope to meet them about the Canaries or Cape
Blank, we kept on our course to the Canaries, but could heare
no tidings of our consorts, which greatly grieued vs.</p>

<p>Thence we went, bearing for the isle of Tenerif, where in the
morning early we had sight of a saile, which being becalmed
vnder the shore, was towing with their boat a head, hauing one
other at her sterne. For this saile we manned our boat, appointing
our men wel for fight, if need should require. The
Spaniards seeing our boat come, entred theirs, and leauing the
ship, sought to saue themselues by flight: but our men pursued
them so fast, that they boorded them, and brought them with
their shippe to our Generall. This ship was laden with 80 tunnes
of Canary-wine, which came not vnto vs before it was welcome.
We kept and manned it, plying that day, and the next night
thereabout. The very next morning we had sight of one other;
to whome in like maner wee sent our boat: but their gunner
made a shot at her, and strooke off a propper yoong mans arme;
yet we inforced her to yeeld, and found 40 tunnes of wine in her.
The Spaniards hauing their free passage, and an acquaintance for
the deliuery of their wines, were all set on shore vpon Tenerif,
making a quicke returne of their long voyage intended into the
West Indies.</p>

<p><!--265.png--><span class="pagenum">268</span></p>

<p>Hence we departed toward Cape Blank; and before wee came
thither, we met againe with the Virgin our rereadmirall, whose
men tolde vs for very trueth, that the Salomon was returned for
England; inforced so to doe, by spending her mast the second
time. Which when our men vnderstood, they were all in a maze,
not knowing what to doe, and saying among themselues that their
force was but small when all our strength were together, and now
we had lost the one halfe of our strength, we were not able to
performe the voyage: and therefore some of them came to the
captain, asking him what he would now do, seeing the Salomon
was now lost, the one halfe of our strength, giuing him counsell
to beare vp for the West Indies, and proue there to make his
voyage, because his first plat for want of strength was cleane
ouerthrown. The captaine hearing this new nouelty, as not vnacquainted
with the variable pretenses of mariners, made them
this answere: Sirs, I made knowen to you all at my comming
out of England what I pretended, and that I meant to go to
Fernambuck, and although at the present we want one of our
ships, yet (God willing) I mean to go forward, not doubting but
to meet her at the appointed places, which are either at Cape
Blank or the islands of Cape Verde: for I am assured that M.
Barker the captaine is so resolute to performe this voyage, that
his mast being repaired, he will not faile to meet vs, and it
were no wisdome for vs to diuert our course, till we
haue sought him at those places where our appointed
meeting is: for the diuerting of courses is the ouerthrow of
most of our actions. And I hope you will be all contented
herewith: for to go any other course then I haue determined (by
Gods helpe) I will not be drawen vnto. With these reasons and
many others shewed, they rested all satisfied: and at our comming
to Cape Blank (God be praised) we met with the Salomon
with no small ioy to vs all; and there she had taken of Spaniards
and Portugals 24 saile of ships and carauels, fisher-men, and had
taken out of them such necessaries as she had neede of. Of
these ships our Captaine tooke foure along with him, with
another that he had taken himselfe, meaning to imploy them as
occasion should serue. At this place he vnderstood one of the
pilots of those ships, that one of the caracks that came out of the
East Indies, was cast away in the rode of Fernambuc, and that
all her goods were layd vpon the Arracife which is the
lower towne. Of these newes we were all glad, and reioyced
<!--266.png-->
<span class="pagenum">269</span>
much; for our hopes were very good, seeing such a booty
before vs.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A gally-frigat carried out of England in
pieces.</span>
Of this good company and happy successe we were all ioyful,
and had great hope of the blessing of God in performance of our
intended voyage, and so after some parle and making frolike for
ioy of our meeting one with the other (praising God for all) we
plied for Maio: where coming to anker, our generall and the
rest of the captaines went ashore to view the place
where we might in best safety set our gally-frigat
together; which frame wee brought from England of
purpose to land men in the country of Brasil. Here
we discharged our great prize of wine, and set her on
fire: but before our coming thither, you shall vnderstand we had
sight of four sailes, which was captaine Venner in his ship the
Peregrine, and a proper Biskaine which he tooke at Cape Blank,
the Welcome of Plymmouth and her pinnesse: all which stood with
vs. But they seeing our flags, not expecting such good fellowes
as we, did beare from vs all they might; which our people tooke
very vnkindly, that being all friends, they would neither enquire,
nor tell vs any newes of our friends, but without making any
shew of kindness would so depart.
<span class="sidenote">The gally-frigat set vp.</span>
As before I haue said, the
choice being made for the place to build the gally-frigat,
ashore it was brought, where the carpenters
applied their worke, still cheered vnto it by the
generals good gifts bestowed among them, and kind vsage of the
rest of the commanders, not without great care of the captaine for
the safety of them all, by keeping good watch: yet one negligent
fellow, which had no knowledge of the countrey, straying from his
company, was by the Portugals taken, and very kindly vsed, and
brought againe vnto vs: for which good the generall rewarded them
well with gifts very acceptable, which they tooke as kindly. While
wee were thus busily imployed about the foresayd galley, we
descried at sea foure sailes, which we had good hope would haue
prooued Indies men, or some to haue brought vs what wee looked
for: but they proued captaine Venner with his fleete, as aforesayd,
who, seeing vs at anker, ankered also; where spending
some time, and being acquainted with our generals determination
for landing, consorted with vs, and their bils, according to the
maner of the sea, were made and signed on either part, we to
haue three parts, and he the fourth, of all that should be taken,
whereby our strength was increased, to all our comforts. Three
<!--267.png-->
<span class="pagenum">270</span>
weeks or thereabouts we stayd in this place before the gally was
finished; which done, putting men into her, and fitting her with
oares, hauing fourteene banks on a side, a mast and saile, the
commandement of her was committed vnto M. Wats, an honest
skilful mariner.</p>

<p>From thence we put againe to sea, and went for the ile Braua,
where we watered: which done, we made no long stay after, but
bent our course as directly as we could for the place, making our
first fall with the land to the Southward of Cape S. Augustine;
from whence wee plied still to our desired port of Fernambuck,
and did so much, that about midnight we came before the harbour;
where some plied vp and downe, holding
that the best policy, to forebeare the entring till day
might giue them light, the harborow being hard, and therefore the
more perillous.
<span class="sidenote">The 29 of March.</span>
Our ships being in safety well arriued, God was
praised: and the generall in his boat went from ship to ship,
willing them to made ready such men as they could spare, with
muskets, pikes, billes, bowes, arrowes, and what weapons they
had to follow him. Himself, with 80 men from his owne ship,
imbarked himselfe in the gally, which carried in her prow a good
sacar, and two murdering pieces.</p>

<p>Our admiral spent all the night in giuing directions to euery
ship to haue their men ready shipped in their boats, for he intended
to enter the harborow at the breake of day, and to leaue
his ships without, till he had gotten the fort and the towne: for
he would not aduenture the ships in, till the harborow was
gotten. Also he prouided fiue ships, which he brought from
Cape Blank, and put men in them as many as could conueniently
saile them, and no more, giuing them charge to enter the
harborow with his boats: for at the entrance of the harborow
rode three great Holland ships, which our admirall doubted
would impeach his going in; and therefore he gaue order to the
men of these fiue small ships, which were not aboue 60
tunnes a piece, if the Hollanders did offer any resistance, to run
aboord of them, and to set their owne ships on fire, and scape in
their boats, which they had for the same purpose, that by this
meanes they might not impeach our entrance. But when the
morning was come, we were fallen aboue halfe a mile downe to
the Northward, below the harborow, which was a great inconuenience
vnto vs: so that before wee could get vp againe, the
ebbe was come vpon vs, and thereby we were forced to houer
<!--268.png-->
<span class="pagenum">271</span>
before the harborow till two of the clocke in the afternoone, in
the sight of all the towne. In this meane time, our ships rode
before the fort without the harborow, about a demy-coluering
shot off: in the which time passed many shot betweene the fort
and the ships, and especially betweene the admirals ship and
them: but no great harme was done on either part. All this
while our admirall kept the men ready houering in the gally and
the boats. The Hollanders that rode in the mouth of the harborow,
seeing our resolution, layd out haulsers, and wound
themselues out of the way of vs. Our admirall was very ioyfull,
and gaue great incouragement to all his men: for, to passe these
three great Hollanders, he held it the greatest danger of all.
About 12 of the clocke the gouernor of the towne sent a Portugall
aboord the admirals ship, to know what he would haue, and
wherefore he came. He returned him this answere: That he
wanted the caracks goods, and for them he came, and them he
would haue, and that he should shortly see. In this processe of
time, the townes-men and inhabitants which saw so much
shipping, and perceiued vs to be enemies, gathered themselues
together, three or foure ensignes of men, esteemed to the number
of some sixe hundred at the least. These came to the fort or
platforme lying ouer against the entry of the harborow, and there
attended our landing: but before our admirall set forward with
his boats, he gaue expresse order to all that had charge of
gouerning the boats or galley, to run them with such violence
against the shore, that they should be all cast away without
recouery, and not one man to stay in them, whereby our men
might haue no maner of retreat to trust vnto, but onely to God
and their weapons.</p>

<p>Now was the time come of the flood, being about two of the
clocke in the afternoone, when our admirall set forward, and
entered the harborow with the small galley, and all the rest of
the boats following him, the Hollanders that rode in the mouth
of the harborow, nothing impeached him: but now the fort began
to play with their ordinance vpon the galley and the boats; and
one of their shot tooke away a great piece of our ensigne out of
the galley. But our saile being set, it was no time for vs to make
any stay, but with all the force we could we ranne the galley
vpon the shore right vnder the fort, within a coits cast of it, with
such violence, that we brake her backe; and she suncke
presently: for there where we landed, went a breach of the sea,
<!--269.png-->
<span class="pagenum">272</span>
which presently cast her away. The boats comming after did
the like. At our arriuall, those in the fort had laden all their
ordinance, being seuen pieces of brasse, to discharge them vpon
vs at our landing; which indeed they did: for our admirall
leaping into the water, all the rest following him, off came these
pieces of ordinance: but almighty God be praised, they in the
fort, with feare to see vs land in their faces, had piked their
ordinance so steepe downewards with their mouthes, that they
shot all their shot in the sand, although, as I sayd before, it was
not aboue a coits cast at the most betweene the place wee landed
and the face of the fort: so that they only shot off one of our
mens armes, without doing any more hurt; which was to vs a
great blessing of God: for if those ordinances had bene well
leuelled, a great number of vs had lost our liues at that instant.
Our admirall seeing this, cried out, incouraging his men,
Vpon them, vpon them; all (by Gods helpe) is ours:
and they therewith ran to the fort with all violence.
<span class="sidenote">The fort of Fernambuck taken.</span>
Those foure ensignes of men that were set to defend our landing,
seeing this resolution, began to go backe, and retire
into certeine bushes that were by the same fort; and being followed,
fledde thorowe a certaine oaze which was drie,
being then but the beginning of the tide: and so
abandoned the fort, and left it with their ordinance to
vs. This day of our arriuall was their Good-Friday, when by
custome they usually whippe themselves: but God sent vs now
for a generall scourge to them all, whereby that labour among
them might be well spared. The fort being taken with all their
ordinance, the admirall waued to the ships, willing them to wey
and come in; which they did with all speed, himselfe taking
order in leauing certeine men in keeping the sayd fort, and
placed the ordinance toward the high towne, from whence hee
suspected the greatest danger; and putting his men in order,
marched toward the low towne, which was about some fourteene
score from the fort: in which towne lay all their merchandize and
other goods. Approching to the towne, he entered the same, the
people imbarking themselues in carauels and boats, with all the
expedition they could. The base towne, of aboue an hundred
houses, being thus taken, we found in it great store of merchandizes
of all sorts: as Brasil-wood, sugars, Calico-cloth, pepper,
cynamon, cloues, mase, nutmegs, with diuers other good things,
to the great comfort of vs all. The admirall went vp and downe
<!--270.png-->
<span class="pagenum">273</span>
the towne, and placed at the South end of the same captaine
Venner and his company, himselfe and his company in the midst
of the towne, and captaine Barker and captaine Addy at the
other end of the towne, giuing great charge, that no man vpon
paine of great punishment and losse of his shares, should break
vp or enter into any ware-house, without order and direction
from the admirall. And this commandement was as well kept
as euer any was kept, where so great spoile and booty was found:
for it was not knowen in all the time of our being there, that any
disorder was committed, or any lodge or ware-house broken
open, or any spoile was made, or pillaging of any thing; which is
a note much to be obserued in such an action: for common
mariners and souldiers are much giuen to pillaging and spoiling,
making greater account of the same then of their shares.</p>

<p>Order being put in all things, we kept a very sure watch this
first night, and the morning being come, our admirall and
captaine Venner, with the rest of the captaines, went about the
towne, and gaue order for the fortifying of it with all expedition:
so that within two dayes it was surrounded with posts and planks,
all that part of the towne next the maine land, at least nine foot
high; for (God be thanked) we found provision in the towne
sufficient store for it. Now it is to be vnderstood, that this
towne is enuironed on the one part by the sea, and on the back-side
by a riuer that runneth behinde it; so that to come to it by
land, you must enter it by a small narrow passage not aboue
forty paces ouer at an high water. At this passage we built a
fort, and planted in it fiue pieces of ordinance, which we tooke
out of the first fort we wan at our comming into the harborow.
Now we hauing the towne in possession, our admirall sent for
the Hollanders by his chyrurgian, which had bene brought vp in
that countrey, a man knowing their conditions, and sober and
discreet of his owne cariage. At his first comming aboord of
them, they seemed to stand vpon their owne guard and defence,
for they were three great and strong ships: but he vsed himselfe
so, that they at the last willed him to come into the greatest of
their ships, which was aboue 450 tunnes. Then he declared to
them our intent, of comming thither, and that they should be
there as sure from any shew of violence or iniury offered them,
as if they were in their owne houses, and if they should thinke
so good, his admirall would fraight them for England, if they
would be content with fraight reasonable, and as they should
<!--271.png-->
<span class="pagenum">274</span>
agree, and it should be at their owne choise whether to go or
not, he would not force them, vnlesse it were to their benefit and
good liking. Although this people were somewhat stubburne at
the first, as that nation is in these causes, yet being satisfied with
good words and good dealing they came aland, and after conference
had with the admirall, they were so satisfied, that they
went thorow with a fraight: and then we ioyned with them, and
they with vs, and they serued vs as truely and as faithfully as our
owne people did, both at watch and ward, by sea and all other
seruices. Within two dayes after our comming in, about midnight,
a great number of Portugals and Indians with them, came
downe vpon vs with a very great cry and noise; but God be
thanked, we were ready for them: for our admirall supposing
some such assault, had prouided all our muskets with haile-shot,
which did so gaule both the Indians and the Portugals, that they
made them presently retreat. And this is to be noted, that there
was both the horse and his rider slaine both with one of these
shot. Our men followed them some fiue or sixe score, but no
further. We lost in this conflict but onely one man, but had
diuers hurt. What was lost of their part, we could not tell, for
they had before day, after our retreat, caried away all their dead.
Within three or foure dayes after our comming in appeared
before the harborow 3 ships and 2 pinnesses, the pinnesses being
somewhat nere, discried our flags, and one of them came in,
which was a French pinnesse, declaring all the rest to be French
bottoms; which our admirall willed should come in: and so
they did. These were Frenchmen of war, and came thither for
purchase. The captaines came aland, and were welcomed;
amongst whom was one captaine Iohn Noyer of Diepe, that the
yere before had taken in our admirall at the iland of Mona in
the West Indies, where his ship was cast away, comming out of
the East Indies. To this man our admirall offered great kindnes,
and performed it, and was not vngratefull for his former benefit
shewed vnto him. This captaine desired of our admirall to
bestow vpon him his ships lading of Fernambuc-wood, which he
granted him, and also his pinnesse, and more, gaue him a
carauel of about 50 tuns, and bid him lade her with wood also;
which with other benefits he gratefully receiued. To the other
two captaines he granted their ladings of wood, the one captaine
being of Diepe, the other of Rochel.
<span class="sidenote">Abraham Cocke going for the riuer of Plate, met
withall.</span>
The captain of Diepe
confessed that he met Abraham Cocke certein moneths before,
<!--272.png-->
<span class="pagenum">275</span>
and being distressed for want of water, gaue him
some, and went with him to a watering place where
he had water enough, and so departed from him,
saying that his men were very weake. The comming
in of these ships did much strengthen vs; for our
admiral appointed both these French and the Flemings to keepe
watch vpon the riuer by night with their boats, euery boat
hauing in her 12 men at the least, and the boats well prouided.
This was for feare of fired ships or barks to come downe; which
our admirall had great care vnto, and caused our ships to ride
by cables and haulsers, at all aduantages to shun them, if by that
meanes they should attempt to put vs out of the harborow;
giuing commandement to vs that watched in the towne, that
what fires soeuer we should espy or see, not one man to start
from his watch or quarter, vnlesse we were by himselfe commanded
to the contrary. Now this order put in all things, and
hauing viewed all the goods in the towne, and thinking our
selues sufficiently fortified, we began to vnlade our ships, which
came as full laden in as they went foorth, but not with so good
merchandize. And this order was taken about the vnlading of
them, and also the lading of goods out of the towne: our men
were diuided into halues, and the one halfe wrought one day,
and the other halfe the other day; alwayes those that wrought
not kept the watch with their furniture in their hands and about
them, and none stept far off or wandred from his colours, and
those that wrought had all their weapons in good order set and
placed by them, so that at an instant euery one knew where to
go to his furniture: and this was very carefully looked vnto.</p>

<p>The third day after our comming in, came down from the
higher towne, which might be about foure miles off vpon a hill,
three or foure of the principall gentlemen of the countrey, and
sayd that from the bishop, themselues, and the rest, they would
haue some conference with our admirall. This newes being
brought to the admirall he hung downe his head for a small
season; and when he had muzed a while, he answered, I must
go aboord of the Flemings vpon busines that importeth me,
and therefore let them stay if they will: and so he went and sate
there with the Flemings from nine of the clocke till two at the
afternoone. In this space diuers messengers went to the
admirall, to come away, for these gentlemen stayd. To whom
he gaue this answere: Are they not gone yet? And about two
<!--273.png-->
<span class="pagenum">276</span>
of the clocke he came aland, and then they tolde him they were
departed. Many of the better sort of our men maruelled, and
thought much, because he would not vouchsafe to come and
haue conference with such men of account as they seemed to be.
But the admiral made them this answere, Sirs, I haue bene
brought vp among this people, I haue liued among them as a
gentleman, serued with them as a souldier, and liued among
them as a merchant, so that I should haue some vnderstanding
of their demeanors and nature; and I know when they cannot
preuaile with the sword by force, then they deale with their
deceiuable tongues; for faith and trueth they haue none, neither
will vse any, vnlesse it be to their owne aduantage. And this I
giue you warning, that if you giue them parle, they will betray
vs; and for my part, of all nations in the world, it would grieue
me most to be ouertaken by this nation and the Spaniards: and
I am glad it was my fortune to pay them with one of their owne
fetches, for I warrant you they vnderstand me better then you
thinke they do. And with this I pray you be satisfied; I hope
it is for all our goods: for what shall we gaine by parle, when
(by the helpe of God) we haue gotten already that we came for,
should we venture that we haue gotten with our swords, to see
if they can take it from vs by words and policy? there were no
wisedome in so doing. You know what it hath cost vs, and
how many men lie wounded that be not yet hole of this other
nights hurts: and therefore from hencefoorth I giue this commission,
that if any be taken, he be sent away with this order,
although he come as a friend, that if he or any other approch vs
from henceforth, he shalbe hanged out of hand: and other
course then this I will not take with them. Which course was
followed, for within 3 or 4 dayes after it was performed by two
taken in the night: and after that we were neuer troubled with
spies: and although diuers slaues came running from their men
to vs, by which we vnderstood much of their working and pretences,
yet the admirall would enterteine few of them.</p>

<p>In this meane time that we began to worke, the Portugals
with the country people were not idle, for seeing vs so busie,
about sixe nights after our comming in, they priuily in the night
cast vp a trench in the sands about a sacar shot from our ships,
minding there to plant ordinance, which would haue offended
our ships greatly; and they would not haue bene able to haue
rode there to take in their lading, which now began to go
<!--274.png-->
<span class="pagenum">277</span>
aboord of them. The admirall hearing this, about 3 of the
clocke in the after noone marshalled our men, and he and all the
rest of the captaines marched toward them. The Portugals
and Indians perceiuing our comming, began to withdraw themselues
within the trench, meaning (as it should appeare) to fight
it out there: but we made no stand, neither did it behoue
vs, but presently approched the trenches with our muskets
and pikes, afore their trenches were thorowly finished: so that
by Gods helpe we entered them. And the Portugals and Indians
left the place, and left vnto vs 4 good peeces of brasse ordinance,
with powder and shot and diuers other necessaries, and among
the rest 5 smal carts of that countrey, which to vs were more
worth then al the rest we tooke, for the lading of our goods from
the towne to the water side: for without them we could not haue
told what to haue done, much of our goods being so heauie,
that without carts we were not able to weyld them: all these
things we brought away and destroyed al those platforms that
they had made, and then we had rest with them for certaine
dayes, in which we went forward, deuiding our marchandize with
captaine Venner according to our consort, and went daily lading
them abord, euery ships company according as their turnes fell
out, but only the three Dutch ships: for the goods being put
into their boats their owne companies laded themselues. And
this farther good chance or blessing of God we had to helpe vs,
that assoone as we had taken our cartes, the next morning came
in a ship with some 60 Negros, 10 Portugal women, and 40
Portugals: the women and the Negroes we turned out of the
towne, but the Portugals our Admirall kept to draw the carts
when they were laden, which to vs was a very great ease. For
the countrey is very hote and ill for our nation to take any great
trauell in.</p>

<p>In this towne there is no fresh water to be had, and therefore
we were euery 5 or 6 dayes compelled to passe ouer the riuer
into the maine land to get fresh water, which after the first or
second time the Portugals kept and would haue defended our
watering, so that we were driuen to water of force, and at seuerall
times some of our men were hurt, and onely two or three slaine,
and with this danger we were forced to get our water.</p>

<p>And as they molested vs in our watering, so they slept not in
other deuises, but put in practise to burne our ships or remoue
them out of the harbour. For within some 20 dayes after our
<!--275.png-->
<span class="pagenum">278</span>
comming in, they had prepared 5 Carauels and filled them with
such things as would best take fire and burne: these they
brought within a mile or little more of our ships, and there set
them on fire, for neerer they could not well come because of our
watch of boates, for, as is abouesaid, the Admirall had alwaies 6
boates that kept watch aboue halfe a mile from the ships for
feare of such exploytes as these, which was the cause they could
not fire them so neere the ships as they would haue done. But
these fired Carauels had the tide with them, and also the little
winde that blewe was in their favour; which caused them to
come downe the streame the faster: which our boats perceiuing
made to them with as much expedition as conueniently they
could, but the tide and wind both seruing them, they approched
toward the ships with great expedition. Our men in the towne
began to be in some feare of them, yet no man mooued or started
from his quarter more then if there had bene nothing to doe.
Also the masters and such as were aboord, were somewhat
amased to see 5 so great fires to be comming downe among their
ships, but they prepared for to cleere them of it, as well as they
could, being prouided afore hande and iudging that some such
stratagems would be there vsed, the riuer being very fit therefore.
But (God be thanked) who was alwaies with vs and our best
defence in this voyage; by whose assistance we performed this
so great an attempt with so small forces. Our companie in the
boats so played the men when they saw the fires come neere our
ships, that casting grapnels with yron chaines on them, as euery
boat had one for that purpose, some they towed aground, and
some they brought to a bitter or anker, where they rode till all
their force was burned out, and so we were deliuered by Gods
helpe from this fearefull danger. Within some 6 nights after this,
which might be about the 26 day after our comming in and
abode there, about 11 of the clocke at night, came driuing
downe other 3 great raftes burning with the hugest fires that
I haue seene. These were exceeding dangerous, for when
our men approched them, thinking to clap their grapnels vpon
them, as they had done vpon the Carauels the night before, they
were preuented: for there stooke out of the rafts many poles
which kept them from the body of the rafts, that they could not
come to throw their grapnels into them: and yet they had this
inconuenience worse then al the rest which most troubled vs.
There stooke out among the poles certaine hollow trunks filled
<!--276.png-->
<span class="pagenum">279</span>
with such prouision of fire workes that they ceased not still (as
the fire came downe to those trunks to set them on fire) to spout
out such sparkles, that our boats hauing powder in them for our
mens vse, durst not for feare of frying themselues with their owne
powder come neere those sparkles of the raftes, but seeing them
to driue neerer and neerer our ships, they wet certaine clothes
and laid vpon their flaskes and bandelers and so ventured vpon
them, and with their grapnels tooke holde of them, and so towed
them on ground, where they stooke fast and were not burnt out
the next day in the morning. Diuerse logs and timbers came
driuing along by our ships, and burning, but with our boats we
easily defended them. And thus (God be praysed) we escaped
the second fires. A third firing was prepared, as a Negro gaue
vs to vnderstand, but this we preuented by our departure. For
this third firing were very great preparations: and we were
credibly informed of certainetie, that this firing should be such
as we should neuer be able to preuent, and assuredly these fires
be dangerous things and not to be preuented vpon the sudden,
vnlesse it be afore prepared for and foreseene. For when it
commeth vpon the sudden and vnlooked for, and vnprouided for,
it bringeth men into a great amazement and at their wits ende.
And therefore let all men riding in riuers in their enemies
countrey be sure to looke to be prouided before hand, for against
fire there is no resistance without preparation.</p>

<p>Also it is a practise in these hot countreys, where there be
such expert swimmers, to cut the cables of ships: and one night
it was practised to cut the Admirals cable, and yet the boate
rode by the cable with two men in her to watch all the night,
and the bwoy onely was cut, but not the cable: but after that
night, seeing then our good watch, they neuer after attempted it.</p>

<p>While all these things passed, our ships (God be thanked)
thorow the industry of our gouernours, and diligent labour of our
men, began to be wholly laden, and all the best marchandize conueyed
aboord our ships, so that our Admirall went to depart that
night, which was the 31 day after our entrance, or else on the
next day at the farthest, and so warning was giuen to all men to
make themselues readie. Our Admiral being aboord his ship
the same morning, espyed in the sands right against the place
where the ships rode, that there was a small banke of sand newly
cast vp, vnder which he perceiued now and then some people to
be: presently he tooke his boat and went to the towne and called
<!--277.png-->
<span class="pagenum">280</span>
all the Captaines together, declaring that the enemies were about
some pretence right against the ships, consulting whether it were
best to sally out and see what they were doing, or depart that
euening according to the former determination. The Admirall
was of opinion to depart that night; saying it was but folly to
seeke warres since we had no neede to doe it: other affirmed, it
were good to see what they did, least the winde might be contrarie
and the ships not get out, and so our enemies may build
vpon vs to our great disaduantage. Well, said the Admiral, the
matter is not great, for there can be no danger in this sally, for
where they worke it is within Falkonshot of our ships, and if any
power should come against you, the ships may play vpon
them with 40 pieces of ordinance at the least, so that
a bird cannot passe there but she must be slaine. I
am somewhat vnwilling you should go, for I haue not
bene well these two dayes, and I am not strong to march
vpon those heauie sands: they answered all at once, you shall
not need to trouble your selfe for this seruice, for you see
it is nothing and of no danger, being so neere the ships, doubt
you not we will accomplish this seruice well ynough, and returne
againe within this houre. The Admirall answered: the danger
cannot be great, but yet you shall goe out strong for feare of the
worst. And so the Admirall marshalled them 275 men French
and English, which were vnder the conduct of Edmund Barker,
captaine Barker of Plimmouth, Viceadmirall to captaine Venner,
captaine Addy, and the three French captaines all going out
together, and they were to march vpon a narrow peece of ground
to the place whether they were sent vnto: in the brodest place
betwixt the sea and the water on the other side, it is aboue a
stones cast for it is a bank of sand lying betweene the riuer and
the sea, so they needed not to feare any comming on their backs
or on their sides, and before them could no man come, but he
must passe by all the ships which no company of men were able
to do without present death. The Admirall commanded them
at their departure to go no further then the place he sent them
to, and so he himselfe went aboord the ships and made readie all
the ordinance for feare of the worst, not knowing what might insue,
although he saw no danger might follow. Thus we marched
quietly till we came to the place we were sent vnto, being right
ouer against the ships: out of which place came some dozen shot,
which seeing vs come, discharged and ran their wayes with such
<!--278.png-->
<span class="pagenum">281</span>
as were working within the said platforme. So that we came
into it and perceiued they had begunne to lay plankes to plant
ordinance vpon. Our Admiral commanded, if there were any
such thing, to burne the plankes and returne in againe, which we
might haue done without hurting of any mans finger: but our
leaders were not content to haue performed the seruice committed
them in charge, but would needes expresly and against their
order march on further to fight with certaine Ensignes almost a
mile off, cleane out of the reach of the ordinance of all our ships,
and where lay the strength of the whole countrey. When our
men began to draw neere those Ensigns of men, the Ensignes
seemed to retire with great speed, which our men followed with
such great hast that some outrunning other some, our order was
broken, and those ensignes retyred themselues into the force of
the whole countrey, so that our formost men were in the midst of
their enemies yer they were aware, which were slaine yer the rest
could come to succour them. The enemies incouraged by this,
came also vpon the rest, which presently began to retire, and the
enemies followed til they came with the reach of the ordinance
of our ships, where they were beaten off and left their pursuit.
In this conflict were slaine captain Barker captaine of the Salomon,
captaine Cotton the Admirals Lieutenant, captaine Iohn Noyer a
French captaine of Diepe, and another French captaine of
Rochel, with M. Iohn Barker and other to the number of 35:
for these were the formost and hottest in the pursuit of the
Ensignes aforesaid, and by their forwardnes came all to perish.
At our returne into the towne the Admiral came to vs much
bewayling the death of so many good men as were lost, wondering
what we ment to passe the expresse order that was giuen vs.
With this losse our men were much danted, but our Admirall
began againe to encourage them, declaring that the fortune
of the warres was sometimes to win and sometimes to loose.
And therewithall he wished euery man to prepare and make
himselfe readie: for that night (God willing) he would depart.
For all our ships were readie and laden, and he would not stay
any further fortune. The euening being come, the ships began
to wey and go forth of the harbour, and God be thanked of his
goodnesse toward vs who sent vs a faire wind to go foorth withall,
so that by 11 of the clocke in the night we were all forth in
safety. The enemies perceiuing our departing, planted a peece
or two of ordinance, and shot at vs in the night, but did vs no
<!--279.png-->
<span class="pagenum">282</span>
harme. We were at our comming foorth 15 sailes, that is, 3 sailes
of Hollanders, the one of 450 tunnes, the other of 350 tunnes,
and the third of 300 tunnes, four sailes of French and one ship
which the admiral gaue the French Captain, 3 sailes of Captain
Venners fleet of Plimmouth, and 4 sailes of our Admirals fleete,
all these were laden with marchandizes, and that of good worth.
We stayed in this harbour to passe all this businesse but onely
31 dayes, and in this time we were occupied with skirmishes and
attempts of the enemie 11. times; in all which skirmishes we had
the better, onely this last excepted. To God be the honour and
praise of all, &amp;c.
<span class="sidenote">Peranjeu 40. leagues northward of
Fernambuck.</span>
The whole fleete being out in safety, the next
day in the morning the Admirall gaue order to the whole fleete
to saile toward Peraniew<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> a harbour lying some 40
leagues to the Northward of Fernambucke, and there
to take in fresh water and to refresh themselues: and
to make prouision for refreshing, our Admirall had
sent thither some 6 daies before two French men in
a smal pinnesse, which Frenchmen he had prouided from Diepe
before his comming out of England for that purpose. For both
these two spake the Indians language very perfectly: for at this
port of Peraniew and an other called Potaju some 6 leagues to
the Northward the Frenchmen haue had trade for brasil-wood,
and haue laden from thence by the Indians meanes, who haue
fet it for them some 20 leagues into the country vpon their backs,
3 or 4 ships euery yere. Thus we all sailed toward Peraniew, at
which place we arriued in the night, so that we were forced to lie
off and on with a stiffe gale of wind, in which we lost the most
part of our fleete, and they not knowing this coast put off to the
sea; and so went directly for England.
<span class="sidenote">Peranjeu a very good harbour.</span>
Our Admirall and some
foure saile more with him put into the harborow of Peraniew,
and there watered and refreshed himselfe very well, with hens,
conies, hares and potatos, with other things, which
the two Frenchmen had partly prouided before his
comming: this is a very good harborow where ships
may ride and refresh very well. But, as I am giuen to vnderstand
since our comming from thence, the Portugals haue
attempted the place and doe inhabite it, and haue put the French
from their accustomed trade. Here hauing watered and refreshed
our selues, we put to the sea, plying after the rest of our fleete
<!--280.png-->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
which were gone before, which we neuer heard of till our arriuall
in England at The downes in the moneth of Iuly, where we
vnderstood the rest of our consorts to be passed vp for London,
Captaine Venner and his fleete to be at Plimmouth, and the
French ships to be safe arriued at Diepe, which to vs was very
great comfort. At our setting sayle from The downes, according
as the custome is, finding the Queenes ships there, we saluted
them with certaine ordinance. The Gunner being carelesse, as
they are many times of their powder, in discharging certain
pieces in the gunner roome, set a barrel of powder on fire, which
tooke fire in the gunner roome, blew vp the Admirals caben, slew
the gunner with 2 others outright, and hurt 20 more, of which 4
or 5 died. This powder made such a smoke in the ship with
the fire that burnt the gunner roome among all the fire workes,
that no man at the first wist what to doe: but recalling backe
their feare, they began to cast water into the gunner roome in
such abundance (for the Queenes ships now and also the other
ships that were in our company came presently to our helpe)
that (God be praised) we put out the fire and saued all, and no
great harme was done to the goods. By this may be seene that
there is no sure safety of things in this world. For now we made
account to be out of all danger, where behold a greater came
vpon vs, then we suffered all the whole voyage. But the almightie
be praysed for euer, which deliuered vs out of this and many
other in this voyage. Our fire being well put out, and we taking
in fresh men (God be praysed) we came to Blacke-wall in safety.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The king of Spaines resolution to proceed in the

I receiued your Maiesties letter bearing date the ninth of

<span class="pagenum">284</span>
determine to proceede in the discouerie and conquest
of Rio Grande according to the relation which was
sent your Maiestie by Don Francisco de Sousa, Gouernour
generall of this realme of Brasilia: together with
a copie of a letter, which your Maiestie sent vnto vs,
bearing date the two and twentieth of March 1596.
Moreouer I receiued another letter from your Maiestie bearing
date the 15 of March 1597. Both which letters were to one
effect. It may please your Maiestie to vnderstand that there are
diuerse Gentlemen in these countreys of as good abilitie as my
selfe, which seeke to liue at home onely for their ease and pleasure,
and are not wont to hazard nor venture their bodies, liues, and
goods so often times in your Maiesties seruice as I haue done and
commonly doe; and can keepe their goods and riches, and not
spend nor wast them as I haue done, and dayly doe so wilfully:
yet neuerthelesse being spent in your Maiesties seruice, I am very
glad thereof. For I and they are alwayes readie at your Maiesties
commandement.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The Captaineship of Paraiua standeth in sixe degr.

And as concerning your Maiesties commandement in commanding
me that I should put to my helping hand in
the conquest of Rio Grande: although this Captaineship
of Paraiua and countrey where I doe gouerne
doth want abilitie for that purpose, yet nevertheless
your Maiestie shall always finde me readie to doe
your Maiestie the best seruice I can: for it is very
well knowen how forward I haue bene alwayes and
am in this conquest, and still doe put to my helping hand, as
partly your Maiestie doth vnderstand by a letter which I wrote
to your Maiesty by my sonne, bearing date the 19 of March
1596 wherein your Maiestie may vnderstand what good seruice I
haue alreadie done therein, and always will be readie to my
power to doe the like in furthering of the said enterprise.</p>

<p>It may please your Maiestie to vnderstand that the third of
Iuly there was brought vnto me a Frenchman a prisoner, who
presented himselfe vnto me. And I examining of him, he tolde
me that he came running away from certaine French ships men of
warre, which came vpon this coast: and he tolde me that he had
serued your Maiestie in the warres of France.
<span class="sidenote">The castle of Cabodelo besieged by the
French.</span>
Likewise he told
me that he left me seuen great ships Frenchmen of warre riding
at an anker in Rio Grande, and that there were 13 French ships
of warre more, which had giuen battery to the castle of
<!--282.png-->
<span class="pagenum">285</span>
Cabodelo, and landed 350 soldiers all in white armour
and the battery continued from Friday vntil the Munday
following both by sea and land, and great store of
Frenchmen were slaine, and two Captaines of the French. On
our side the Captaine of the castle was slaine, and other two
Portugals hurt: other harme they had none. There were but
twentie Portugals in the castle, and fiue pieces of ordinance.
They ment to haue kept the castle, and to haue traded with the
Indian people. So seeing they could not take the castle, they
hoysed sayles, and went from thence to Rio Grande: and being
altogether they are in number 20 saile at an anker in Rio Grande.
And some of them determine after they be new trimmed and
drest, and haue taken in fresh victuals, and stayed there vntill
Easter, then to depart from thence to the Honduras, and so to
burne and spoyle some townes thereabout.</p>

<p>I certified Manuel Mascarenhas of these informations by my
letters, requesting him to send me with all expedition those
souldiers which were in Fernambuck to ayde me, and to defende
this Captaineship from the enemie. But the Friers of The
Couent would not consent thereunto nor suffer them to be sent
vnto me.
<span class="sidenote">The countrey of Petiguar rebelleth against the
Portugals.</span>
So I was forced to make shift with those souldiers
only which I had in my gouernment and tooke them with me,
and marched to the place where the enemies were entrenched,
vpon Whitsunday in the euening about three of the
clock, hauing in my company a Negro of the countrey
of Petiguar, which was our guide, he brought vs where
the enemies campe was; and presently I did assault
them and slew great score of them, burning the
villages and countrey of these rebels, which did ioine with the
Frenchmen, and tooke many of them prisoners. So they told me
that there were ten great French ships of warre which were at an
anker in Rio Grande.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A rich siluer mine found at Copaoba within sixe
dayes iourney of Paraiua.</span>
Likewise I was informed, that there is a Frenchman called
Daurmigas, which hath discouered and found great store of siluer
in a place called Copaoba.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The siluer hath bene
tried and melted, it is very good and fine siluer, and
there is great quantite. The man which told me of
this hath beene in the mine, and hath seene it tried
and melted. And I haue bene myselfe once in the
place: it is but 6 dayes iourney from this Captaineship.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a>
Perhaps Caproba.</div>

<p><!--283.png--><span class="pagenum">286</span></p>

<p>Furthermore this Frenchman told me that one Monsieur Mifa
a French Captaine, and a kinsman of the gouernour and Vice-admirall
of Diepe in Normandie, had one of his armes strooken
off at the siege of the castle of Cabodelo; who is departed from
Rio Grande, with determination to come backe hither againe the
next yeere in the moneth of Ianuarie following, and to inhabite
in this countrey of Paraiba, which is 20 leagues from Fernambuck,
because of the great store of siluer, which they haue
alreadie found here.</p>

<p>Moreouer I am enformed that a noble man of France called
The earle of Villa Dorca doth intend to come vpon this coast
with a great fleete from Rochel. It were good that your Maiestie
would send into France to knowe the certainetie thereof.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">All the Canibals of Petiguar ioyne with the
Frenchmen against the Portugals.</span>
The Frenchman likewise told me that all the Canibals
of Petiguar have ioyned themselues in companie
with certaine Frenchmen, which were cast away in
two ships vpon this coast. The one of these ships
which were cast away was one Rifoles, and the other
ship was this mans. And those Frenchmen which
came vpon this coast did ioyne themselues with those Canibals
which did rebell, and did diuide themselues into two squadrons.
So I sent presently to Manuel Mascarenhas that he should send
me aide and munition. But he sent me word againe, that he
had none to spare, and that he did purpose with all speede to goe
himselfe to Rio Grande; and that he was not able to furnish
himselfe so well as he could wish, nor to bring his souldiers into
the field, for lacke of shot, powder, and other munition, which he
did want.</p>

<p>Hereupon once more the 29 of Iuly I with my souldiers
marched to the enemies campe, and there ioyning battell with
the Indian rebels, which ioyned with the Frenchmen that were
their leaders, I did set vpon them, and slew great store of them,
and tooke fourteene of them prisoners. They doe report the
very same newes, which the other Frenchmen did tell me as
touching the ships which were in the harbour of Rio Grande;
and how their pretence was to haue come and haue taken vs,
and spoyled the countrey.</p>

<p>But now being put to flight and hauing received the overthrow,
they can get no victuals to victuall their shippes: which hath
bene the cause that they are mightily hindred in their intent, and
dare not come any more to attempt vs. And the Indians are so
<!--284.png-->
<span class="pagenum">287</span>
dismayed, that in haste they will haue no more helpe nor aide of
the Frenchmen. So by these meanes of necessitie the Indians
must submit themselues vnto vs, considering they are quite
spoyled and ouerthrowen for a long time. Likewise they haue
enformed me touching the siluer mines which are found, that it
is most true. For those French shippes which were in Rio
Grande haue laden great store of the oare. Wherefore I certified
Manuel de Mascarenhas of the Frenchmens newes, and
howe euery thing did stand wishing him to make readie foure
ships and three hundred souldiers, and so to take the harbour of
Rio Grande, being now cleered and voyde of the enemie: and to
search out the situation of the place, and where were best to
fortifie and to build some fortes for the defence of this riuer,
where neede shall require. Hereunto Mascarenhas sent me
word, that when he went himselfe, and found it true which hath
beene reported touching the siluer mines, that then he would
send both men and ships. Therefore your Maiestie must giue
order, that the rest of the Gouernours shall ayde and assist me in
these warres: otherwise of my selfe I am not able to doe more
then I haue alreadie done in defending of this countrey against
our enemies which are many.</p>

<p>It may please your Maiestie to be aduertised, that from time
to time I haue written vnto Don Francisco de Sousa Gouernor
general of this realme, who is in Baia, as concerning these
Frenchmen of warre: but he will not answere me to any purpose
because I do write vnto him for such things as I doe want, which
are shot, powder, men, and munition requisite for your Maiesties
seruice and safegard of this captaineship. For here are neither
shot, powder, nor any thing els to defend vs from our enemies;
nor any that wil put to their helping hands for the defence of this
countrey, and the service of your Maiestie. And therefore it
were needful that your Maiesty should committ the charge and
gouernement into the hands of Diego Sierua, with expresse charge
that all the captaines and commanders vpon paine of death obey
him and be readie at all times to aide and assist him in your
seruice. Otherwise this countrey cannot be kept and maintained,
hauing so great warres continually as we haue, and are
troubled withall. For this Diego Sierua is a very good souldier,
and hath good experience; and is fit to gouerne this countrey.
Your Highnesse is also to send his Commission with expresse
commandment to follow these wars; otherwise this countrey cannot
<!--285.png-->
<span class="pagenum">288</span>
be kept, but daily they will rebell. For here are none
that will serue your Maiestie so iustly as he will do: who will
haue a great care in any thing which shal concerne you Maiesties
seruice touching the estate of this countrey. For the Gouernour
Sousa doth spend your Maiesties treasure in building his owne
ingenios or sugar milles.</p>

<p>And those Captaines which your Maiestie intendeth to send
hither must bring with them shot, powder, and all kind of weapons,
furniture, and munition for the defence and safegarde of this
countrey, and for the conquest of Rio Grande. For there is no
kind of munition in al this countrey to be had, if occasion should
serue. It were also good that your Maiestie should send order for
the building of a couple of Forts or Castles at Cabadelo, for they be
very needefull for the defence of the enemie, which dayly doth
warre against this Captaineship.
<span class="sidenote">The countrey of Paraiua in danger dayly to be
lost.</span>
For that man which shall
gouerne this countrey, if he be no more fortunate then I haue
bene hitherto, shall not misse one time or another, but he
shall lose all the countrey. If Don Francisco de Sousa
had sent me those two hundred and fiftie souldiers
which I did send for, which were in garison in the
castle of Arrecife, which doe nothing but spend your
Maiesties victuals and treasure, and had not sent them to Baiha,
where there was no neede, these warres of Petiguar had bene
ended long agone, and had saued your Maiesty a great deale of
charges which you had spent in folowing of this conquest of Rio
Grande. I have chosen one Captaine Iohn de Matas Cardoso
to be Gouernour of Cabodelo, who is a very sufficient man.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A great controuersie touching the gouernment of the
Indian townes.</span>
Furthermore, it may please your Maiestie to vnderstand, that
the chiefest Friers of this Monasterie of S. Antonie
haue complained on me to the lord Gouernour
generall, and haue caused great strife and debate
betweene him and me touching the gouernment and
rule of these Indian townes. For the Friers would
command and gouerne both the Indians and their townes as well
in Ecclesiasticall as Temporall causes, as touching the punishment
of the bodies of such as are offenders. But I haue resisted
them in your Maiesties name, and haue alleaged, that none but
your Maiestie must rule and gouerne them and their countrey,
and that the townes appertaine to your Maiestie, and not vnto the
Friers. But the Gouernour hath written a letter vnto me, signifying
that he hath pronounced a sentence against me in the
<!--286.png-->
<span class="pagenum">289</span>
Friers behalfe, which is this. The King our master hath sent a
decree and certaine statutes touching the good gouernment and
orders to be executed and kept in those Indian townes: and that
vpon sight hereof I shall presently banish all the Mamalukes and
white men which dwell in any of those Indian townes with all
speede, and that none of them from hence forward shall enter
into the said villages, without commandement and consent of the
said Friers. So this sentence was presented vnto me by the
Reuerend father Custodio, Prior of Sant Anton of Brasil, with a
further postcript of the gouernour importing these words: I doe
likewise charge and commaund you the Gouernour of Paraiua,
that presently vpon sight hereof you shall restore those villages
and houses which you haue burned and destroyed in the last
warres, and likewise the towne of S. Augustine, and that you
shall build them againe at your owne proper cost and charges:
for the Friers alleage that these townes were giuen them, by a
decree sent them from Pope Pius Quintus, that the said Friers
should gouerne and rule them.</p>

<p>On the other side I haue pronounced another sentence against
the said Friers in your Maiesties name, and for your Maiestie,
alleaging that those townes, villages, and subiects appertaine and
belong vnto your Maiestie, and that in temporall causes I am to
punish those offenders, which shall rebell against your Maiestie:
and as touching ecclesiasticall causes that the Vicar of this
Cathedrall church shall rule, gouerne and instruct them in the
Christian religion. So we both haue appealed vnto your Maiestie
herein, and your Maiestie may peruse all our writings, and
then determine that which shall be best and most profitable for
your Maiesties seruice and enlargement of your crowne. For
through these broyles the inhabitants of this Pariaua forsake their
houses and dwelling places, and so do some of the Friers, because
they cannot be suffered to rule and gouerne.</p>

<p>Also the Indians haue complayned against me, because I haue
burned their villages in this last rebellion. Wherefore if your
Maiestie doe not send some order for this countrey and see into
these cases, it will breed great dissension and rebellion among
vs, and we shall be readie to cut one anothers throat before it be
long.</p>

<p>Thus I thought good, according to my humble bounden dutie,
and for the seruice of your Maiestie and quietnesse of this realme,
to certifie your Maiestie the truth of the whole matter; hoping
<!--287.png-->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
in short time that your Maiestie will send some good order to
qualifie these broyles: for there is great hatred and malice among
vs. Iesus Christ preserve and keepe the royall person of your
Maiestie with long health, as it pleaseth him. From the Captaineship
of Paraiua this present 20 of August. 1597.</p>

<p>Memorandum, that from Cabo de buena Esperan&ccedil;a vnto

<p>The Sunne being in {Taurus, Gemini, Cancer} the tide hath his course Northwest.</p>

<p>The Sunne being in {Leo, Virgo, Libra} no current.</p>

<p>The Sunne being in {Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorne} the tide hath his course Southeast.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a>
It may be as well to point out that the truth as to the currents of the
South Atlantic is as follows:&mdash;<br />
<br />
From the Cape of Good Hope the current flows North along the West
Coast of Africa till it reaches a point somewhat North of the Congo, when it
turns to the West. North of Ascension it divides. One portion, the South
Equatorial Current, flows North West into the Gulf of Mexico, while the
other subdivides, and whilst part flows South West down the coast of South
America, the remainder returns by the South of Tristan d'Acunha to the Cape
of Good Hope.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">A ruttier or course to be kept for him that will sayle from Cabo

Cabo Verde to Fernambuck.</div>

<p>The ship that goeth from Cabo Verde to Brasil, must goe
<!--288.png-->
<span class="pagenum">291</span>
Southsoutheast: and when she is within 5 or 6 degrees of the
Equinoctial she must go Southeast and by South. And if she
haue the ternados, that is thundrings and lightnings, then thou
must go altogether South, or that way and by that boord that
doth profit thee most. And take this for aduise, that hauing the
general winds, and if the wind be at South or Southeast, then go
Southwest, or westsouthwest.
<span class="sidenote">Ye that will sayle to Brasil, must not come within
60 or 70 leagues of the coast of Guinea.</span>
And if the winde be South, then
goe Southwest, and by this way but little, for it is not a way for
thy profit, because the more thou goest this way, the
more will be thy trouble, because thou mayest not
come neerer the coaste of Guinea then 60 or 70
leagues vnto the sholde called Os baixos de Santa
Anna. And being this distance from the same, thou
shall cast about the other way towards Brasil, and
the wind will be large.</p>

<p>Thou shalt vnderstand that the ship that keepeth this course
to Fernambuck, and goeth in October or after, and chanceth to
goe to windward of the Isle of Fernando de Loronha,
when thou commest to 8 degrees, or 8 and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>,
[Ed: Of Southerly latitude] then
thou shalt go West and beare with the land. Thou
must take this for a warning, that if going West in 8 degrees
thou see land, then looke to the Northward, and thou shalt see
certaine white cliffes. Then I aduise thee that thou goe well to
the Southward. And this is to bee vnderstoode from October
forward, for then the time is most subiect to Northeast, and
Eastnortheast winds. And if thou find thy selfe in the sayd
height aboue mentioned, and seest cliffes, and seest a cape to
the Southward, and seest no more land to the South, then
make accompt that thou art at Capiguoari: and from thence
to Fernambuck thou hast sixe leagues, and hast a good
port.</p>

<p>Thou shalt take this for a warning, that if in 8 degrees and a
halfe thou see land lying all flat, thou mayest goe neerer it, and
be bold till thou come in tenne or twelue fadomes: And then
thou shalt see a great grosse land along the sea-coast which is
called Capitagua: And being East and West with this land, and,
as I haue sayd, in tenne or twelue fadomes water; and the time
being from October to Februarie, then thou needest not to feare
any thing: but looke to the South and thou shalt see the cape
of S. Augustine: and looke to the North and thou shalt see a
point, and to the Southeast a point called Punta de Olinda,
<!--289.png-->
<span class="pagenum">292</span>
where Aponiquay standeth. And the land from the cape to the
poynt called Punta Olinda lieth North and South.</p>

<p>I aduise thee that if thou be East and West with the cape of
Saint Augustine, thou shalt see within the land an high hill,
hauing as it were a saddle vpon it like to a camel: And thou
shalt see to the Southwards three hills along the sea, and then
presently thou shall see the coaste to lie Northeast and Southwest.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The height of the cape of S. Augustine, of Olinda
and Fernambuck.</span>
Thou shalt vnderstand that from this cape of Saint Augustine,
to the towne of Olinda, thou hast nine leagues to
the North. And this cape standeth in eight degrees
and two third parts, and Olinda standeth in eight
degrees and a quarter, and Fernambuck standeth in
eight degrees. And this course is to be vnderstood
to be obserued and kept, if thou depart from Lisbon
in October or Nouember.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">In what height they shall seeke land that depart
from Lisbon in February or March.</span>
Take this aduise, that if thou depart in February
or March from Lisbone, then thou shalt goe to beare
with the land in nine degrees, because that from
March forwards raigne most commonly Southeast and
Southwest windes. And if by this height and course
thou bring thyselfe nigh to the shore, feare not to
bring thy ship into 18 or 20 fadomes, for all the coast
is cleane: and there are no more dangers, but such as the sea
doth breake vpon.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">How to know the cape of S. Augustine.</span>
And if after thy fall with the land thou haue occasion to goe
to the Northward, and so going seest certaine sholdes, doubt not
to come for the North, and thou shalt see the cape of Saint
Augustine, which lyeth as it were sloaping to the seaward,
and hath as it were a Whales head, and hath
vpon it a round hill, with many hilles round about it.
And if thou come along the sea coast much about
the depth aboue mentioned, thou shalt see a little Island
called Saint Alexio: And from this Island to the cape of Saint
Augustine are foure leagues, and it standeth in eight degrees and
three quarters.</p>

fall with the land in 12 degrees or 12 and a halfe.</p>

<p>And take this for a warning, that when thou seest a white
land, and long bankes of white sand, which shew much like
linnen cloth when it is in whiting, then thou must go along from
the North to the South vntill this white land doe end: and thou
needest not to feare to goe along the coast, for there are no
sholds. Before thou be cleane past the white land or white

bay, I say on the Northside of the bay, which is called Tapaon:<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">When a man may beare in with Bahia.</span>
And marke well that if thou looke to the Southward, and seest

Bahia. And if when thou goest into Bahia to the
Northwest, and seest the sea to breake, feare nothing:
for it is the breach of a certaine banke, whereon thou
shalt haue alwayes 5 or 6 fadomes water: and this be sure of.</p>

<p>Thou shalt vnderstand that if thou come for this place from

<p>And if thou goe from Bahia to Fernambuck, then I aduise thee

A Enseada de Vazabaris. Also if thou come from
Portugal and fallest with the land in eleuen degrees,
beare not in with it, neither come neere it, for thou

white cliffes: and on the toppe and something downewarde it is
blacke: at the foote of this high land to the Eastward thereof it
hath certaine steps like a lather: and to the sea it hath a sharpe
poynt that lyeth into this Cape almost halfe a league. To the

Southward of this Cape where the lather is, there is a little Bay,
which is the entrance of Rio de Galegos, it ebbeth and floweth
here 12 fathomes. A man must haue a great care how he goeth
in here for the cause abouesaid: but he must keepe himselfe out
and not anker in it.</p>

<p>From Rio de Galegos to the Streits of Magelan the coast lyeth
Northnorthwest and Southsoutheast: 8 leagues vnto Cabo de la
virgin Maria, which is the entrance into the Streit: and 4 leagues
before a man come to this Cape there are white cliffes with
certaine blacke spots in them; and they be caused with the
falling downe of the water.
<span class="sidenote">Ciudad de Nombre de Iesus called by M. Candish
Port Famine because he found al the Spaniards famished, and the towne it

Here is water inough, and thou
mayest come to an anker hard aboord the shore, and
hast a good defence for a Southwest wind. And the
Cape it selfe is the highest land of all, and is like to
Cape Saint Vincent in Spaine: and it hath on the
east side a ledge of rockes, and a poynt of sand, with
diuers sands which shewe themselues at a lowe
water: thou must take great heede heere and giue
them a good breadth halfe a league or a quarter of a

and then thou mayest stirre away Southwest. And
when thou commest to the lower land and into tenne

at Northeast, or any other wind off the sea inclining
to the Southeast, must not come to anker, but
presently be sure to passe by: because in Sommer
this place is much subiect to Southwest winds, which
blow right in: and they put a man from his tackle,
and make him to loose his voyage.
<span class="sidenote">From March forward the winds are fauorable for the

And from March
forwards there blow favourable winds from the sea to
goe from this Cape to enter into the Streits, from
this said Cape the Streits go in to the Northwest 14 leagues:
and the chanell waxeth narrower and narrower vnto the first
Streit which runneth Eastnortheast, and Westsouthwest. And

comming out of the mouth thereof a man must keepe himselfe a

vnto Cabo de San Gregorio, which is a high white
cliffe, and is a good road for any wind from the
Northwest to the Southwest. But men must beware
and not trust the Indians of this Cape: for they be subtill and
will betray a man.</p>

<p>From this Cape beginneth the second Streit which is called
Nuestra Sennor&agrave; de Gracia, and lyeth Eastnortheast and Westsouthwest
3 leagues. And comming out of this Streit thou shalt

Sebastian Cabota, intended for the Malucos by the
Streights of Magellan, but perfourmed onely to the riuer
of Plate in April 1527. Taken out of the information of
M. Robert Thorne to Doctor Ley Ambassador for King
Henry the eight, to Charles the Emperour, touching the
discouery of the Malucos by the North.</div>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">This was the fleete wherein Cabot discouered the

In a flote of three ships and a carauel that went from this

departed in Aprill last past, I and my partner haue
one thousand foure hundred duckets that wee employed
in the sayd fleete, principally for that two
Englishmen, friendes of mine, which are somewhat
learned in Cosmographie, should goe in the same

of the countrey, and to be expert in the nauigation
of those seas, and there to haue informations of

An extract out of the discourse of one Lopez Vaz a Portugal,
touching the fight of M. Fenton with the Spanish ships,
with a report of the proceeding of M. Iohn Drake after
his departing from him to the riuer of Plate.</div>

<p>Vpon the relation of Pedro Sarmiento concerning the streits of
Magellan, that they might be fortified, and for that the king
heard, that there were ships in England preparing for the same
streits, he commanded Diego Flores de Valdes a noble man of
Spaine, to passe thither with 23 ships, and 3500 men to stoppe
the passage of the Englishmen.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Fiue ships of this fleete cast away on the coast of
Spaine.</span>
There went in this fleete the gouernour of Chili, with 500 olde
souldiers that came out of Flanders: but this was the
vnhappiest fleet of ships that euer went out of Spaine:
for before they came from the coast of Spaine a
storme tooke them, and cast away fiue of the fleete
and in them aboue 800 men, and the rest came into
Cadiz. But the king sent them word that they should proceede:
and so there went out on the voyage 16 of the shippes, for two
more of their fleete were much spoyled by the storme which they
had.</p>

<p>In these sixeteene shippes Pedro Sarmiento was sent to bee
gouernour in the straites, and had assigned vnto him 500 men to
stay there with him, and hee carried with him, all kinde of
Artificers to make him forts, and other necessaries, with great
store of ordinance and other munition.</p>

<p>This fleete because it was late, did winter on the coast of
Brasil, in the riuer of Ienero: and from thence they went
when the winter was past, and about the height of 42 degrees
they had a sudden storme, so that Diego Flores beat
<!--305.png-->
<span class="pagenum">308</span>
it vp and downe 22 dayes, in which time hee lost one of the
best ships he had, which had in her 360 men and 20 women, that
went to inhabit the Streits: and in this ship also was most part of
the munition which should haue bene left in the Streits, so in the
ende the storme grew to bee so great, that the ships were not
able to endure it any longer, but were put backe vnto an Island
called Santa Catelina:<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and there he found a barke
wherein were some fryers going for the riuer of Plate:
<span class="sidenote">M. Fenton took these fryers.</span>
which friers told him of two great English ships, and
a pinnesse, which had taken them, but tooke nothing from them,
nor did them any harme, but onely asked them for the king of
Spaines ships.</p>

<p>Hereupon Diego Flores knowing that these English ships
would goe for the Streits, determined to goe thither, although it
was in the moneth of Februarie, and choosing 10 ships of the 15
that were left, hee left two ships that were not in case to goe to
sea at the Iland, and into the other three ships which were old,
and shaken with the storme hee put all the women, and sicke
men in all the fleete, and sent them to the riuer of Ienero, and
he with the other 10 returned againe for the Streits.</p>

<p>The three ships in which the sicke men and women were, went
to Brasil, and there they found within the port of S. Vincent the
two ships before mentioned.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A fight betwixt our 2 English ships and three
Spanish ships.</span>
They woulde haue had the English men to haue gone out of
the harbour, and thereupon they fell to fight, and
because that these three ships were weake with the
storme, and the men that they had were the worst in
all the fleete, the Englishmen easily put them to the
worst, and sunke one of them, and might haue sunke
another, if the Englishmen would: but they minded
not the destruction of any man: for that is the greatest vertue
that can be in a man, that when hee may doe hurt, yet he
will not doe it.
<span class="sidenote">They victual at Spirito Santo.</span>
So the Englishmen went from this port to
Spirito Santo, where they had victuals for their merchandise,
and so they went backe for England,
without doing of any harme in the Countrey.</p>

<p>The cause why these English shippes vnder the conduct of
M. Fenton went not to the streits, I know not: but some say
<!--306.png-->
<span class="pagenum">309</span>
that they were put backe by foule weather: other some say that
it was for feare of the kings ships.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Iohn Drake proceedeth on to the riuer of
Plate.</span>
But the pinnesse of these two ships went from them, in which
was Captaine Iohn Drake: the cause why they parted
I know not, but the pinnesse came into the riuer of
Plate, and within fiue leagues of Seale Island, not
farre from the place where the Earle of Cumberlands
shippes did take in fresh water, shee was cast away vpon a ledge
of rockes: but the men were saued in their boat, which were in
number 18, who went ashore on the Northside, and went a
dayes iourney into the land, and met with the Sauages which are
no men-eaters, but take all the Christians that they can, and
make them slaues.</p>

<p>But the Englishmen fought with them and the Sauages slew
fiue of them, and tooke 13 aliue, which were with the Sauages
about 15 moneths.
<span class="sidenote">Richard Faireweather remayneth in the riuer of

But the Master of the pinnesse,
whose name was Richard Faireweather being not
willing to indure the misery that hee was in, and
hauing knowledge that there was a towne of Christians
on the other side of the riuer, he in a night
called Iohn Drake, and another yong man which was with them,
and tooke a very little Canoa, which had but two oares, and so
passed to the other side of the riuer, which is about 19 leagues
broade, and were three dayes before they could get ouer without
meat: and comming to land, they hit vpon an high way that
went towardes the Christians: and seeing the footing of horses,
they followed it, and at last came to an house where there was
corne sowed, and there they met with Indians seruants vnto the
Spaniards, which gaue them meate, and clothes to couer them,
for they were all naked, and one of the Indians went to the
towne, and told them of the Englishmen: so the Captaine sent
foure horsemen, who brought them to the towne behind them.</p>

<p>This Captaine clothed them, and prouided lodging for them,
and Iohn Drake dieted at the Captaines table, and they were all
very well intreated, the Captaine purposing to send
them for Spaine.
<span class="sidenote">Iohn Drake sent to the Viceroy of Peru.</span>
But the Viceroy of Peru hauing
newes hereof, sent for them, and so Iohn Drake was
sent to him, but the other two were kept there,
because they were married in the countrey, so that I know no
more of their affaires.</p>

<p>Vpon this comming of the Englishmen, there were prepared

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
50 horsemen to goe ouer the riuer to seeke the rest of the

or not.</p>

armes and mouthes it hath to enter into it, as farre as it
is nauigable with small barks.</div>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The Isle of Santa Catelina. Rio Grande.</span>
From the Isle of Santa Catelina, (which is in 28
degrees of Southerly latitude) vnto Rio Grande is
fortie leagues. This riuer by another name is called
Ygai. The Island of Santa Catelina is sixe leagues
in length: It hath two small Ilands on the North side betweene
the maine land and it: and on the South side it hath a shoald of
rockes, which lyeth hidden very neere vnto the poynt of the Isle.
You are to passe betweene the firme land and the poynt of the Isle.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Puerto de Biaza, or Laguna.</span>
From Santa Catelina to the hauen of Bia&ccedil;a, which by another
name is called la Laguna, are twelue leagues: it is a
good hauen within: but you must stay the full sea to
enter into it, because it hath shoaldes in the mouth,
and it may be knowen by a small Island which lyeth a league
into the sea which is called La Isla de Raparo, that is The Island of
succour or defence, and you must ride there to search the chanell.</p>

<p>From this harbour vnto the riuer before named there is no
hauen for a ship to harbour it selfe. And Rio Grande hath
many shoalds in the mouth thereof. It is a riuer that none but
very small shippes can enter into. And this riuer diuideth the
countrey of the people called Carios from other nations which
are called Guauaes.
<span class="sidenote">Certaine Ilands 12 leagues distant from the mouth
of the riuer of Plate, which are 3 in number.</span>
And from this riuer vnto the entrance of
the mouth of the riuer of Plate it is al a plaine land, and very
low: you must saile all along two or three leagues
into the sea from the shore, vntill you come to certain
Islands<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> which lye twelue leagues from the

Castillos and Palmarones.</div>

<p>From Rio Grande vnto these Islands are 68 leagues.
And from these Islands vnto the Cape of Saint
Marie the coast runneth Northeast and Southwest,
<!--308.png-->
<span class="pagenum">311</span>
somewhat inclining a poynt to the South. The Islands are
three, and may be knowen as you come from the sea by two
poynts, which shew like the eares of a conie: you may ride
betweene them and the maine.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Isla de Lobos.</span>
From Rio Grande to the Cape of Saint Marie are 80 leagues:
and the Cape may be knowne by one Island which lyeth from it
a league and an halfe into the sea. You may sayle betweene
the maine and that Island, because there is aboue 8
or 9 fathoms water. The Cape of Saint Mary
standeth in 35 degrees of Southerly latitude.</p>

<p>The Cape of Santa Maria vpon the poynt thereof hath a little
hill which standeth ouer against the Isle of Seales.
<span class="sidenote">The way to enter into the riuer of Plate.</span>
From this coast of Santa Maria you must coast along
the land alway on the North shore, and along the
same are certaine Bayes. From the Cape vnto the
riuer of Solis are tenne leagues, the coast runneth East and West.
There standeth an Island ouer against the mouth thereof. From
this riuer of Solis vnto Los tres Mogotes which are on the maine
land is three leagues. And from Los Mogotes vnto the Isles of
Saint Grauiel are other 8 or 9 leagues more; all this distance
runneth East and West. These are fiue small Islands: to ride
here you must keepe somewhat neere the maine within an harquebuze
shot halfe a league before you come at the Islands, and
straightway you shall see a crosse standing on the said land,
and there is an harbour for some winds.</p>

<p>From Saint Grauiel vnto the riuer of Sant Iuan going along
the same coast, I say on the North shore, are three leagues: it is
very well knowen by the broken cliffe which it hath, which is a
white hill. The entrance into this riuer is very dangerous;
because it is shallow, and none but very small shippes can enter
into the same: the entrance thereof is on the West side very
neere the land, great Carackes may ride within the harbour.
From this riuer vnto the Isle of Martin Gar&ccedil;ia are three leagues:
it is one Island alone, and you must sayle along the coast on the
North shore: and after you be come vnto the Island, I say, ouer
against the same, you shall haue three fathoms water, and on the
West side it hath a little creeke where you may ride.</p>

<p>He that desireth to crosse ouer the riuer of Plate vnto the
riuer de Buenos A&euml;res from the Isles of Saint Grauiel, must shape
his course Southwest: and the cut ouer is sixeteene leagues and
vpon his arriuall on the South shore of the riuer, hee must seeke
<!--309.png-->
<span class="pagenum">312</span>
a chanell of three fathomes water, and straite he must goe along the
coast vntill hee come to a broken cliffe and a poynt like vnto the
firme land, which is distant from this chanell three or foure
leagues: and when thou seest this broken cliffe, keepe thee a
league from it.
<span class="sidenote">The first Spanish colonie was planted in the riuer
of Buenos A&euml;res.</span>
Here vpon this riuer of Buenos A&euml;res was the
first Colonie that Don Pedro de Mendo&ccedil;a planted.
This riuer lieth very much hidden: because it is not
seene, it is very shallow at a low sea, wherefore you
must come in with the first of the flood.</p>

<p>From the Isle of Martin Gar&ccedil;ia vnto certaine small
Islands which are called the Isles of Saint Lazarus is
two leagues, these are shoalds: and to goe thither you must goe
hard aboord the maine, for there goeth the chanell: all this is to
be passed on the North shore, and with small barkes, and with
good heede.</p>

<p>From the Isle of Martin Gar&ccedil;ia to the mouthes of the riuer are
eight leagues in passing along on this side to seeke one of the
mouthes of the riuer Parana, as it is hereafter described. But
you had need first to harbour in a bay, which is in the very cliffe
or Barranca, and you must stay for the full sea.
<span class="sidenote">Rio Vruay.</span>
And if you fall
into the mouth of the riuer which is called Vruay,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> you
must leaue it on the right hand, I say on the North
side.
<span class="sidenote">Parana is the great riuer.</span>
And foorthwith leauing the said mouth forward toward the
West, you may enter into the first mouth although
it seeme narrow; or rather you may enter into any of
the mouthes: for all of them meete together in
Parana, which is the maine riuer.</p>

<span class="sidenote">Rio de las Palmas.</span>
And hee that desireth to goe from the Isle of Martin Gar&ccedil;ia to
the riuer of Palmas, which is the best of all these
armes, or mouthes to speake more properly, is to
shape his course to the West, and comming ouer to
the other shore, and sayling along the coast Northnorthwest hee
shall discouer the mouth of this riuer of Palmas: and hee must
enter hard by Los Iuncales, which lye on the South side: and
afterward within is very deepe sounding. All these mouthes of
this riuer which are 5, are full of sholds towards the East aboue
the space of two leagues. And if the course of the water were
not swift there, you could not enter into them, as I haue already
sayd, and you must passe all along with much heede and foresight.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Cape Blanco on the South side of the mouth of the
riuer of Plate a very low and euen land.</span>
And if peradventure you haue passed Cape Saint Marie and
<!--310.png-->
<span class="pagenum">313</span>
are come ouer to Cape Blanco, consider it, that it is
so euen and smooth a land, that you can scarcely
discerne it a league from the maine, vnlesse it be a
very cleare day: and after this sort the coast lieth
low vnto the riuer de Buenos Aeres. And from
thence the coast lyeth somewhat high vnto the
entrance of the riuer de Palmas: all the coast
runneth as I sayd before.
<span class="sidenote">Man-eaters vpon the south shore.</span>
And all along this coast
are naughty people, which eate those which they kill,
and many Tygers.</p>

<p>From the Isle of Martin Gar&ccedil;ia vnto Saint Saluador is nine or
tenne leagues. This is an Island which standeth two leagues within
the first mouth: where Sebastian Cabota tooke possession. And
this countrey is very well peopled by a people called Carios; and
you most beware of all these people: for they are your deadly
enemies. The most Southerly mouth of Parana called Rio
de Palmas is sixteene leagues long, and it hath many turnings,
and many palme or date-trees growing neere it, whereupon it is
called The riuer of palme trees: and forthwith it entreth into the
riuer Parana, as soone as these sixteene leagues are finished.
All the other armes containe likewise sixteene leagues in length,
sauing one small or narrow arme, which is called The riuer de
los Beguaes; for this containeth fortie leagues in length. From
this you must enter by the mouth of the riuer of Palmas vnto
Santo Spirito, the way is fiftie leagues: you are to passe still
along the cliffes. As you enter on the left hand which is on the
West shore vp this riuer there are many Isles, lakes and small
riuers, and many Indians which are your enemies.</p>

<p>From Santo Spirito vnto a people which are called Los
Tenbuis is fifteene leagues. This is by the narrow arme whereby
they passe into the riuer Parana: it is the more because it is the
longer way. From the Tenbuis by this narrow arme vpward vnto
the Quiloacas, which is another nation, are twentie leagues; and
all vp this riuer is great store of people.</p>

<p>From the Quiloacas, to a place where the Spaniards now haue
builded a towne, are fifteene leagues.
<span class="sidenote">This towne perhaps may be the towne of Santa Anna,
15. leagues.</span>
From this
towne vnto the people called Los Mequaretas is
twentie leagues. Here are many sholds which continue
thirtie leagues. All these thirtie leagues are
sunken lands: where are many Isles, flats, and
nations, which are our enemies.</p>

<p><!--311.png--><span class="pagenum">314</span></p>

<p>From the Mequaretas vnto the people called Mepenes ate
these thirtie leagues. And from hence begin the coasts of the
firme land vnto the mouth of the riuer Paraguai; sauing that
there are eight leagues more of sunken ground.</p>

<p>From the Mepenes vnto the month of the riuer of Paraguai
are thirtie leagues: it is a riuer that cannot be mistaken
although it hath many armes and Islands and dangers, it hath
a marke two leagues beneath the mouth on the East
side, to wit, an high land, where are 7 points, which
we call the 7 currents: and immediately aboue these
currents there is an Island as you passe vp the riuer
ouer against the poynt aforesaid standeth the mouth
of Paraguai.
<span class="sidenote">The towne of Piquiri or Picora 170 leagues vp the

This mouth is very plaine to be found
in seeking whereof a man cannot be deceived.
From this mouth the riuer of Parana is diuided, which is a
very great riuer: and it goeth vnto the towne of
Piquiri, which is an hundred and seuentie leagues:
and it runneth all this space North and South, and
in the way are many flats and shoalds; and great

A relation of the discouery, which in the Name of God the Fleete
of the right noble Fernando Cortez Marques of the Vally,
made with three ships; The one called Santa Agueda of
120. tunnes, the other the Trinitie of 35. tunnes, and the

<div class="DescrHdr2">Francis Vlloa a captaine of Cortez departeth with a Fleete from
the port of Acapulco, and goeth to discouer vnknowen
lands, he passeth by the coast of Sacatula and Motin, and
by tempest runneth to the riuer of Guajaual, from whence
he crosseth ouer to the hauen of Santa Cruz, along the
coast whereof he discouereth 3. smal Ilands, and within
two dayes and an halfe returning to the maine land he
discouereth the riuer called Rio de san Pedro y san Pablo,
and not far distant from thence two other riuers as big or
greater then that of Guadalquiuir which runneth by Siuil,
together with their head springs.</div>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Acapulco in 17. degrees of latitude.</span>
We imbarked our selues in the hauven of Acapulco
on the 8. of Iuly in the yeere of our Lord 1539,
calling vpon almighty God to guide vs with his holy
hand vnto such places where he might be serued, and
<!--314.png-->
<span class="pagenum">318</span>
his holy faith aduanced. And we sailed from the said port
by the coast of Sacatula and Motin, which is sweete and pleasant
through the abundance of trees that grow thereon, and riuers
which passe through those countries, for the which wee often
thanked God the creatour of them. So sailing along we came to
the hauen of S. Iago in the province of Colima: but before we
arriued there, the maine mast of our ship called Santa Agueda
was broken by a storme of winde that tooke vs, so as the ship
was forced to saile without her mast vntil we arriued in the said
hauen. From the port of Acapulco to this hauen of Colima wee
were sayling the space of 20. dayes. Here we stayed to mende
our mast and to take in certaine victuals, water, and wood, the
space of 27. dayes. And wee departed from the saide hauen the
23. of August, and sayling by the Isles of Xalisco the 27. or 28.
of the saide moneth wee were taken with an extreame tempest
wherein wee thought we should have perished, and being tossed
and weather-beaten, wee ranne as farre as the riuer of Guajalua
in the Prouince of Culiacan.
<span class="sidenote">Santa Cruz in the point of California.</span>
In this storme wee
lost the pinnessee called Sant Thomas, and because
wee had lost her wee crossed ouer to the port of Santa
Cruz in California: for while wee were so beaten in
the former tempest, the pilot of the Barke signified vnto vs, that
he perceiued she beganne to leake, and that already she had
received in much water, insomuch that she beganne to founder:
whereupon, to helpe her neede, and that we might meete together
in a knowen hauen, if by chance the tempest should
separate vs, as it did indeed, we willed him to repaire to the
hauen of Santa Cruz, where we meant to repaire his harmes and
our owne. Wherefore being all arriued in this place of Santa
Cruz, wee stayed there fiue dayes and tooke in water, wherein
we heard no newes of our Barke which we had lost: Whereupon
the Captaine resolued to follow on our voyage; wherefore we set
saile the 12. of September, and as we sailed wee saw along the
coast of the said hauen 3. Islands, whereof the Captaine made no
great accompt, thinking there coulde be no great good found in
any of them. These Islands seemed not to be great; wherefore
he commanded the Masters and pilotes to proceed on
their voyage, and not to leese time without any profit.
<span class="sidenote">Rio de san Pedro y san Pablo.</span>
So sailing ouer the gulfe of California, in two dayes
and an halfe we came to the riuer of S. Peter and S.
Paul, finding before we entered into the same a small Island in
<!--315.png-->
<span class="pagenum">319</span>
the mouth of the Riuer, being 4. or 5. miles distant from the
maine. On both sides of the Riuer wee beheld goodly and
pleasant great plaines full of many green and beautiful trees, and
farther within the land we beheld certaine exceeding high mountaines
full of woods very pleasant to beholde. From this riuer
wee sailed still along the coast the space of 15 leagues, in which
course wee found two other Riuers in our iudgement as great or
greater then Guadalquiuir the Riuer of Siuilia in Spaine. Al the
coast by these Riuers is plaine as the other which we had passed,
with many woods: likewise within the lande appeared great
mountaines couered with woods very beautifull to beholde, and
beneath in the plaine appeared certaine lakes of water. From
these Riuers we sailed 18 leagues, and found very pleasant
plaines, and certaine great lakes whose mouthes opened into the
Sea: here our Capitane thought good throughly to discouer
what those lakes were, and to search whether there were
any good hauen for his ships to ride in, or to harbour
themselues, if any tempest should arise; and so he commaunded
a boat to be hoised out into the Sea, with a Master and fiue or
sixe men to view them, and to sound the depth, and bottom of
them: who went thither, and found the coast very sholde, and
the mouthes of the lakes; whereupon they made no accompt of
them, onely because the shore was so shallow, for otherwise the
land was very pleasant. Here at euening we saw on the shore
10. or 12. Indians and fires. The aforesaide two Riuers are two
leagues distant the one from the other little more or lesse, and
are great, as I haue saide, and being in the last of them we went
vp to the ship-top, and saw many lakes, and one among the rest
exceeding great, and wee supposed that they had their springs
out of this great lake, as other Riuers also haue from other lakes,
for wee sawe the course of them seuerally each by themselues,
hauing goodly woods growing all along their bankes. The
currents of these Riuers might be discerned three leagues within
the Sea: and at the mouthes of them were many small stakes set
vp for markes: the shore here is plaine and sandie, and the
countrey very pleasant.</p>

<p><!--316.png--><span class="pagenum">320</span></p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 2.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Sailing along the coast from the two aforesaid great Riuers, they
discouer three mouthes of lakes and a goodly Countrey,
they come vnto Cabo Roxo, and take possession of those
countreys for the Emperours Maiesty. A discourse of the
faire hauens that are on those coastes, and of very many
Islands which they saw, before they came to the Cape
called Capo de las Plaias.</div>

<p>This day wee sailed along the coast the space of 16. leagues,
and in the midst of this voyage, there is a Bay very faire of 4. or
5. leagues, hauing certaine bankes or fences in it, in beholding
whereof we tooke great pleasure. The night following we road
in 20. fadome water.
<span class="sidenote">The coast runneth Northward.</span>
The next day we followed our
voyage toward the North, and hauing sailed 3. or 4.
leagues we saw 3. mouthes of lakes which entred into
the land, where they became like standing pooles. Wee road a
league distance from these mouthes in 6. fadome water, to see
what they were, and sent our boat with certaine men, to see if
there were any entry for our ships: for halfe a league from
shore we had not past one or two fadome water. Here our men
saw 7. or 8. Indians, and found sundry sorts of greene herbes
somewhat differing from those of Nueua Espanna. The Countrey
is plaine, but farre within the land they saw great and small hils
extending themselues a great way, and being very faire and
pleasant to behold. The day following we proceeded on our
voyage sayling alwayes in sight of the plaine coast toward the
Northwest, in 10. or 15. fadome water. And hauing sailed 6.
good leagues we found a Bay on the coast within the land of
about 5. leagues ouer, from whence the coast trendeth Northwest,
and this day we sailed about 16 leagues. All this coast is plaine,
and not so pleasant as that which we had passed: here are certaine
small hilles, but not so high as those which we had found
before. Thus we sailed all night Northwest, and vntil the next
day at noone, at which time we fell with a headland of white
sand, where by the height which we tooke that day we found
our selues to be in the latitude of 27. degrees and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. This cape
we called Capo Roxo. All the coast is plaine and faire and
cleane sand, and we saw within land some few trees not very
great, with certaine mountaines and woods 3. or 4. leagues
<!--317.png-->
<span class="pagenum">321</span>
distant from the said cape: and here likewise appeared a mouth
of a riuer, which (as far as we could discerne) made certaine
lakes vp within the land: from the mouth whereof for the space
of a league into the sea it seemed to be very sholde, because the
sea did breake very much. Here we saw within the land 3. or
4. riuers.
<span class="sidenote">The coast runneth Northward.</span>
In this sort we sailed on our voiage to the
Northward, and because we had not good weather
we road that night in a great hauen lying in our way,
where on the shore wee saw certaine plaines, and vp within the
land certaine hilles not very high: and continuing our course
toward the North about 3. leagues from this hauen, we found an
Iland of about one league in circuite lying before the mouth of
the said hauen. And sailing forward we found an hauen which
hath two mouthes into the Sea, into which we entered by the
Northermost mouth, which hath 10. or 12. fadome water, and so
decreaseth till it come to 5. fadome, where we anckered in a
poole which the Sea maketh, which is a strange thing to beholde,
for there are so many entrances and mouths of streames and
hauens, that we were all astonied at the sight thereof: and these
hauens are so excellently framed by nature, as the like are not to
bee seene in the world, wherein we found great store of fish.
Here we anckered, and the Captaine went on shore, and tooke
possession, vsing all such ceremonies as thereunto
belong.
<span class="sidenote">Fishing weares like those of Virginia.</span>
Here also wee found certaine weares to
catch fish made by the Indians, and certaine small
cottages, wherein were diuers pieces of earthen pots
as finely made as those in Spaine. Here by commandement of
the Captaine a Crosse was erected vpon an hil, and it was set
vp by Francis Preciado. In this place we saw the Countrey full
of fresh and greene grasse, howbeit differing from that of New
Spaine, and vp within the Countrey we saw many great and very
greene mountaines. This Countrey seemed very goodly and
delightsome to all of vs, in regard to the greennesse and beautie
thereof, and we iudged it to be very populous within the land.
From this hauen we departed and kept our way toward the
Northwest with good weather, and began to finde hard by the
sea-shore exceeding high mountaines spotted with white, and in
them we saw many foules which had their nestes in certaine
holes of those rocks, and sailed 10. leagues vntil night, all which
night we were becalmed. The next day we followed our course
Northwest with good weather: and from that day forward we
<!--318.png-->
<span class="pagenum">322</span>
began to see on the Westerne shore (whereon the foresaid hauen
of S. Cruz standeth) certaine Islands or high lands, whereat we
reioyced not a little. And so sayling forward we met with an
Island about two leagues in bignesse, and on the East shore
hauing still the maine land and Islands in sight, we sailed 15.
leagues vntil the euening, alwayes finding hard by the sea-coast
exceeding high mountaines bare of trees, the land appearing still
more plainely vnto vs on the Westerne shore.
<span class="sidenote">Some take the land of California to be nothing but
Islands.</span>
Whereupon wee
began to be of diuers opinions, some thinking that this coast of
Santa Cruz was a firme land, and that it ioyned with the continent
of Nueua Espanna, others thought the contrary,
and that they were nothing else but Islands, which
were to the Westward. And in this sort we proceeded
forward, hauing the land on both sides of vs,
so farre, that we all began to wonder at it. This
day we sailed some 15. leagues, and called this Cape Capo de
las Plaias.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 3.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Of the Streight which they discouered on the coast of Capo de
las Plaias, and of the pleasant Countrey which they found
before they came to the rockes called Los diamantes. Of
the wonderfull whitenesse of that Sea, and of the ebbing
and flowing thereof: and of the multitude of Islands and
lands, which extend themselues Northward from the
hauen of Santa Cruz.</div>

<p>The day following we sailed vntil night with so good weather,
that we ran about 20. leagues. All this coast along the shore is
full of little hilles without grasse or trees: and that night we
anckered in 20. fadome water.
<span class="sidenote">A Streight of 12. leagues broad, of exceeding
depth.</span>
The next day we followed our
voyage beginning to saile before breake of day
Northwestward, and we came into the midst of a
Streight or mouth which was 12 leagues broad from
one land to the other, which Streight had two Ilands
in the midst thereof being 4. leagues distant the one
from the other: and here we discerned the countrey to be plaine,
and certaine mountaines, and it seemed that a certaine gut of
water like a brooke ran through the plain. This streight (as far
as we could perceiue) was very deep, for we could finde no
<!--319.png-->
<span class="pagenum">323</span>
botome: and here we saw the land stretching afarre off from the
one shore to the other, and on the Westerne shore of the hauen
of S. Cruz, the land was more high with very bare mountaines.
<span class="sidenote">The Streight here runneth Northward.</span>
The day following we passed on our way toward the
North, and sailed some 15. leagues and in the
midst of our way we found a circuit or bay of 6.
leagues into the land with many cooues or creeks, and the
next day following continuing our course we sailed some
10. leagues, and the coast in this dayes iourney was all of high
mountaines naked and bare without any tree. It is very
deepe hard by the shore, and that night we were constrained
to stay by reason of the contrary winde. The next morning
before breake of day we sailed still along the coast to the Northwest
vntil euening, and ranne about some 15. leagues. All along
this shore wee sawe very goodly mountaines within the land, and
many plaines and downes with some few trees, and
the sea-shore was all sandy.
<span class="sidenote">Small rocks called Los Diamantes.</span>
In the midst of this
dayes course we found certaine small rockes in the
sea 4 leagues distant from the maine, were the said land maketh
a great point into the sea, and here we stayed the rest of the
night, where we had a very great shower of raine. The day
following we proceeded on our voyage, and sailed vntill night by
a compasse or turning, some 8. or 9. leagues, and saw within
land a few mountaines hauing no trees vpon them, but the Sunne
shining alwayes very cleare, as farre as we could descry, they were
very great, on the Westerne shore of the hauen of Santa Cruz.
Here we stayed all night because we found very shallow water
and sawe the sea very white, and in a maner like to chalke, so
that we all beganne to marueile thereat. The day following wee
went forward againe along the coast Northwestward, and sailed
eight leagues, and saw another land which stretched Northwest,
and was full of high mountaines. And still continuing this
course we searched very diligently to see if there were any passage
through betweene both the landes, for right forward wee saw no
land. And thus sayling we alwayes found more shallow water,
and the Sea thicke, blacke, and very muddie, and came at length
into fiue fadome water: and seeing this, wee determined to passe
ouer to the land which wee had seene on the other side, and here
likewise wee found as little depth and lesse, whereupon we rode
all night in fiue fadome water, and wee perceiued the Sea to
runne with so great a rage into the land, that it is a thing much
<!--320.png-->
<span class="pagenum">324</span>
to be marueilled at, and with the like fury it returned backe
againe with the ebbe: during which time wee found 11. fadome
water, and the floode and ebbe continued from sixe to sixe
houres.</p>

<p>The day following the Captaine and Pilote went vp to the
shippes top, and sawe all the lande full of sand in a great round
compasse, and ioyning it selfe with the other shore and it was so
low, that whereas wee were a league from the same wee could
not well discern it, and it seemed that there was an inlet of the
mouthes of certaine lakes, whereby the Sea went in and out.
There were diuers opinions amongst vs and some thought that
that current entered into those lakes, and also that some great
Riuer there might be the cause thereof. And when we could
perceiue no passage through, nor could discerne the countrey to
be inhabited, the Captaine accompanied with certaine of vs went
to take possession thereof. The same day with the ebbe of the
Sea wee fell downe from the other coast from the side of Nueua
Espanna, though alwayes we had in sight the firme land on the
one side of vs, and the other Islands on our left hande, on the
side of the port of Santa Cruz situate on the Westerne shore: for
on that side there are so many Islands and lands, so farre as we
could descry, that it was greatly to be wondered at: for from the
said hauen of Santa Cruz, and from the coast of Culiacan we had
alwayes in a maner land on both sides of vs, and that so great a
countrey, that I suppose if it should so continue further inwarde,
there is countrey ynough for many yeeres to conquer. This day
wee had the winde contrary, and cast ancker vntil the flood
increased which was in the afternoone, and then wee set saile
likewise with contrary winde vntill midnigt, and then cast ancker.</p>

<p>The next day wee departed, shaping our course along the
coast Southwest, vntill midnight with little winde, and wee sawe
within the land high mountaines with some openings, and wee
made way some three leagues, and all the next night wee were
becalmed, and the next day we continued our course but a little
while, for we sailed not aboue fiue leagues, and all the night were
becalmed, and sawe the land full of bare and high mountaines, and
on our left hande wee descried a plaine countrey, and saw in the
night certaine fires.</p>

<p><!--321.png--><span class="pagenum">325</span></p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 4.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">They land vpon an Island to discouer the same, and there they
see many fires, which issue out of certaine mountaines,
and many Seale-fishes. Here they take an Indian, and
can not vnderstand his language. Running along they
discouer another Island, and take possession thereof for
the Emperours Maiestie, and a great hauen in the firme
land, which they call Ancon de Sant Andres, or The
hauen of S. Andrew.</div>

<p>The next day following our course we saw a great hauen with
an Island in the sea, within a crossebow shoote of the firme
land, and in this Island and on the firme land were seene many
smokes by the iudgement of all the company; wherefore the
captaine thought good that wee should goe on land to know the
certainty of these smokes and fires, himselfe taking ten or twelue
of vs with a boate in his company:
<span class="sidenote">Burning mountaines.</span>
and going on
shore in the Island, we found that the smokes proceeded
out of certaine mountaines and breaches of
burned earth, whereout ascended into the aire certaine cinders
and ashes which mounted vp to the middle region of the aire, in
such great quantitie, that we could not esteeme lesse then twenty
lodes of wood to bee burned for the causing of euery of these
smokes, whereat wee were all not a little amazed.</p>

<p>In this Island were such abundance of Seales, as it was wonderful.
Here we stayed that day, and killed a great number of these
Seales, with whom we had some trouble: for they were so many,
and ayded one another so well, that it was strange to behold; for
it fell out, that while we were occupied in killing some of them
with staues, they assembled twentie or thirty together, and lifting
themselues vp assayled vs with their feete in a squadron, and
ouerthrew two or three of our company on the ground: whereupon
letting goe those which they had in their hands, they and
the others escaped vs and went into the sea, howbeit wee killed
good store of them, which were so fatte as it was wonderfull: and
when we opened some of them to haue their liuers, we found
certaine small blacke stones in their bodies, whereat we much
marueiled. The next day wee rode at anker here for lacke of
good weather to sayle withall: whereupon the Captaine determined
to goe on shore with nine or ten of his company, to see
<!--322.png-->
<span class="pagenum">326</span>
whether there were any people there, or any signe of people that
had bene there, and they found on the maine land seuen or eight
Indians like to Chichimecas, which were gone a fishing, and had
a raft of canes; who so soone as they espied vs ranne away and
betooke themselues to flight, but being pursued by vs, in the end
we tooke one of them, whose language was so strange that wee
could by no meanes vnderstand him; his clothing was nothing at
all, for he was starke naked. These people caried their water in
bottels made of beasts skins, they fished with hookes of bone,
and wee found good store of their fishes, whereof we tooke three
or foure dozen.</p>

<p>The Indian which we had taken seeing himselfe in our hands
did nothing but weepe, but the Captaine called him, and made
much of him, giuing him certaine beades, with a hat and certaine
hookes of ours, and then let him goe. And it seemed that after
hee was returned to his companions, he declared vnto them how
we had done him no harme at all, showing them the things which
wee had giuen him: whereupon they also determined to come
vnto vs to our boate, but because it was now night, and that our
shippes were farre from vs, we forced not to stay for them,
especially because it was a bad place and a dangerous. This
countrey hath on the sea coast high and bare mountaines with
certaine grasse in some places like vnto our broomes, or like vnto
woods of rosemary.</p>

<p>The next day wee sayled neere to the coast on the same
side, with very scarce winde, and in a manner calme, and ranne
not aboue fiue leagues, and all the night following we lay
becalmed, and we saw on the shore fiue or sixe fires.
<span class="sidenote">Ancon de S. Andres, or The hauen of S. Andrew in
32 degrees.</span>
The
land is high with very high mountaines without grasse, hauing
certaine caues in them: the next day also, and part of the
night following we were becalmed: and the morrow
after we followed our course along the sayd coast,
and passed betweene a great Island full of exceeding
high mountaines, and the maine land, where we saw
a very great hauen in the firme land in which wee
ankered to see what it was, and being come to an anker, the
Captaine and some of vs went on land the same day to see if
there were any people and fresh water, and wee found certaine
small cottages couered with drie grasse, with certaine little staues
layd ouerthwart, and we went a little way into the countrey which
was very baren, by certaine small and streight pathes, and found
<!--323.png-->
<span class="pagenum">327</span>
a little pond or pit, but drie and without water; and here the
Captaine tooke possession for the Marques of the valley<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in the
name of his Maiestie, and after this we returned to our ship, and
that night we sawe foure or fiue fires on the land. The next day
the Captaine determined, because hee had seene these fires, to
goe on shore, and so with our two boates we went fifteene or
twenty of vs vnto certaine crooked strands two leagues from the
place where our ships rode, and where we had seene the fires,
and we found two Indians of exceeding huge stature, so that they
caused vs greatly to wonder; they caried their bowes and arrowes
in their hands, and as soone as they saw vs leap on shore they
ran away, and wee followed them vnto their dwellings and lodgings,
which were certaine cottages and bowers couered with
boughs, and there we found great and small steps of many
people, but they had no kind of victuals but onely cuttle fishes
which wee found there. The countrey toward the sea side
seemed but barren, for we saw neither trees nor greene grasse
there, yet were there certaine smal pathes not well beaten, and
along the sea coast we saw many tracts of dogges, hares, and
conies, and to certaine small Islands neere vnto the maine we
saw Seale-fishes. This hauen is called Ancon de Sant Andres.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A great Island.</span>
The next day we proceeded on your voyage, sayling betweene
the maine and an Island, which we suppose to be
in circuit about a hundreth or eighty leagues, sayling
sometimes within one, and sometimes within two
leagues of the maine. The soile of this Island is of certaine
mountaines not very steepe with caues in them, and as farre as
wee could descrie by the coast, there appeared no signe of any
plaine countrey. Here from this day forward wee began to bee
afraid, considering that wee were to returne to the port of Santa

<span class="pagenum">328</span>
Cruz; for it was supposed, that all along this mighty gulfe from
the entrance in at Culiacan vntil the returning backe vnto the
said hauen, was all firme land, and also because wee had the
firme land alwayes on our right hand and it goeth round circle-wise
vnto the sayd hauen; but many thought and hoped that we
should finde some mouth or out-let, whereby we might passe
through vnto the other coast. What our successe was we will
declare in the relation following.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">They returne from the bottome of the gulf of
California.</span>
The next day being Thursday wee sayled with scant winde,
for it was almost calme, and passed beyond that
great Island, hauing firme land alwayes on our right
hand, and coasting (as I sayd) very neere vnto it.
The next day likewise we sayled with little winde, it
being in a manner calme, and passed neere vnto the
shore by certaine round baies, and certaine points which the
land made, which was pleasant to behold being somewhat greene,
and there seemed to be some creeke there. This Friday at
night wee sayled altogether with a fresh gale, and at breake of
day wee were betweene the maine land, and an Island on our
left hand which was somewhat big, as farre as we could discerne.
Here was a great bay in the firme land, and before it was a point
which stretched farre into the sea. The firme land seemed to
bee much fresher and pleasanter then those lands which we had
passed, hauing many bankes and hilles of indifferent height, and
beautifull to behold.</p>

<p>The countrey (as farre as wee could discerne) was so pleasant
and delightfull, that wee all desired to goe on shore, and to
search vp into it two or three dayes iourney, to see whether it
were inhabited or not. Wee saw within the land of that bay two
fires. The night following being Saturday we sailed, continually
with a prosperous and fresh gale, and the wind was so great that
we drew our bonet to our maine sayle, and sayled so till the
morning.</p>

<p>On Sunday the twelfth of October we found our selues altogether
inclosed with land, on the right hand with the maine,
which compassed vs before and behinde, and on the left hand
with an Island of a league and a halfe; and betweene the maine
and the Island in the midst of the sea there lay a small Islet, and
also betweene the sayd maine and the Island there were two
mouthes, through which there appeared, a passage whereby afterward
we passed through. This maine was much more fresh and
<!--325.png-->
<span class="pagenum">329</span>
greene then the other which wee had passed, and had certaine
plaines and points of mountaines of pleasant view, and full of
greene grasse. Here all this night we saw two or three villages
which were very great, and at breake of day we saw a Canoa or
boate made of canes, which came from the land out of a creeke,
and wee stood still vntill it came neere vnto vs in the ship, and
they began to speake in their language which no man vnderstood,
whose pronuntiation was like to the Flemings, and being called
they returned with great haste vnto the shore, and we were very
sory because our boate had not followed them.</p>

<p>Here happened vnto vs a very strange thing, which was, that
as this Indian returned to the shore in certaine of these creekes
where a number of his fellow Indians were, as wee viewed that
part, we sawe fiue Canoas issue foorth, which came toward vs:
whereupon wee stayed to see what they would doe. In the
meane while our Admirall came vp vnto vs, which was neere the
shore, for he also had seene them, and so being come together
we cast anker, expecting what those Canoas would doe. In the
meane while our Generall commanded vs to make ready our
boate, and to furnish the same with oares and men, to try if we
could by any meanes take some of them, that we might come to
some knowledge of them, and that wee might giue them some of
our trifles, and specially of our hookes and beads to winne
their friendship. The Indians with their fiue Canoas approached
within one or two stones cast of vs, and then began to speake
very loude vnto vs in a very strange language, alwayes standing
vpon their guard to retire themselues with speede. When our
Captaine saw this, and that they would not come, neere vs, but
rather retired, he commanded sixe mariners to goe into the boate
from the sterne of the ship, and himselfe also went with them
with all possible haste toward the Indians. The Indians returned
to the shore with so great celeritie, that they seemed to flie in
those little Canoas of canes. Neuerthelesse our men vsed such
diligence that one of the Canaos was boarded and taken; but
the Indian in the Canoa seeing himselfe now taken leapt into the
water, and our men followed with their boat to take him, but
seeing himselfe within their reach, he ducked with his head vnder
their boate, and so deceiued them, and then rose vp againe, and,
with their oares and with staues they gaue him certaine blowes,
to amaze him, but nothing would serue them; for as they were
about to lay handes vpon him hee still diued vnder water, and
<!--326.png-->
<span class="pagenum">330</span>
with his hands and feete got neere to the shore: and as hee rose,
vp aboue the water, he called to his felowes which stood on the
shore to behold, crying Belen with a loud voyce, and so they
pursued him, and strooke him sometimes being very neere the
shore, and he alwayes went calling the rest of his fellowes to
come and helpe him, whereupon within a short while after three
other Canoas came foorth to succour him, being full of Indians
with bowes and arrowes in their handes, crying with a loude voyce,
that wee should come on shore: these Indians were of great
stature and saluage, fat also and well set, and of a browne colour.
Our Captaine perceiuing this, least they should wound any of our
people with their arrowes, returned backe, and commanded vs
immediately to set sayle, and so foorthwith wee departed.</p>

<p>This day the wind skanted, and we returned to anker in the
foresayd place, and our Admirall rode from the firme land toward
the Island, and wee which were in the ship called The
Trinitie lay neere vnto the maine, and before breake of day
wee departed with a fresh gale. And before we disemboqued
out of that chanell we saw certaine grasse very high and
greene vpon the maine: whereupon a mariner, and the
Pilot went vp into the top, and saw the mouth of a riuer which
ranne through that greene countrey
into the sea.
<span class="sidenote">Port Belen is a very good hauen.</span>
But because our
Admirall was vnder all her sayles farre from vs, we
could not tell them of this riuer, where wee would
haue taken water, where of we had some neede, and
because it was a very good hauen to goe on shore to
take it, and therefore without watering we followed
our course. On Monday we departed from this hauen which is
like vnto a lake, for on all sides we were compassed with land,
hauing the continent before, behinde vs, and on our right side,
and the Island on our left side, and we passed foorth at those
mouthes before mentioned, which shewed an out-let into the
open sea. Thus wee sayled along still viewing the situation of
the countrey, reioycing all of vs at the sight thereof, for it alwayes
pleased vs more and more, still appearing more greene and
pleasant, and the grasse which wee found neere vnto the shore
was fresh and delectable, but not very high, being (to all our
iudgements) not past a spanne long. Likewise the hills which
we saw, which were many, and many downes made a very
pleasant prospect, especially because we iudged, that there were
many valleys and dales betweene them.</p>

<p><!--327.png--><span class="pagenum">331</span></p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 6.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">They discouer a very great bay with foure small Islands in it,
whereas they take possession. As they sayle along and
discouer diuers Islands they come at length to the port of
Santa Cruz, where not being able to get any knowledge of
those Indians, although they lay in waite for them at a
place called The well of Grijalua, they departed thence.
They haue a perilous and long tempest, which, ceased,
after they had seene a light on their shrowdes.</div>

<p>At our comming out of these openings we began to finde a
Bay with a very great hauen, enuironed with diuers small hilles
hauing vpon them greene woods and pleasant to behold. In this
bay and strand were two small Islands neere vnto the shore, one
of the which was like vnto a table about halfe a league in bignes,
and the other was a round hill almost as big as the former.
These Islands serued vs onely to content our sight, for we passed
by them without staying, hauing but a slacke winde on Munday
morning: all which day we followed our course with the foresayd
slacke winde, and within a while after it became flat contrary, so
that we were constrained to anker at the sayd point of the sayd
hauen; and on Tewsday at breake of day we set sayle, but made
but little away all the day, because the winde continued contrary,
although but very weake. The night following wee were becalmed
a little beyond the point of this hauen; but about midnight wee
began to haue a fresh gale, and on Wednesday in the morning
wee were seuen leagues distant from that point. This countrey
shewed (as it was indeede) more plaine then the rest, with certaine
small woody hilles, and within the other point which was before
descried, the situation seemed to be more pleasant and delightsome
then the rest which we had passed. And at the vttermost
end of the point were two small Islets. The sayd Wednesday
about nine of the clocke the winde blew a good gale, and we
sayled by euening between seuen and eight leagues, and came
ouer against a land not very high, where wee saw certaine creekes
or breaches not very ragged, into euery of which a riuer seemed
to fall, because the soyle was very greene, and had certaine
<!--328.png-->
<span class="pagenum">332</span>
trees growing on it farre bigger then those which we had
found before. Here the Captaine with fiue or sixe
men went on shore, and taking possession passed vp one of
those riuers, and found the footing of many Indians vpon the
sand. On the bankes of that riuer they saw many fruitful trees,
as cherry-trees and little apple-trees, and other white trees: they
found also in the wood three or foure beasts called Adibes, which
are a kind of dogs. The same night we set sayle with the winde
off the land, which blew so freshly, that it made vs to strike
our foresayle; and on the sixteenth of October at nine of the
clocke we came neere vnto a point of certaine high mountaines,
on which day being Thursday we made little way, because the
winde ceased, but it rose againe in the night, whereupon by the
breake of day on Friday wee came before the sayd point being
sixe or seuen leagues off. The land seemed to be very mountainous
with certaine sharpe points not greatly clad with grasse,
but somewhat bare. On our left hand wee saw two Islands, the
one of a league and a halfe, the other not so much, and it seemed
that we drew neere to the port of Santa Cruz, whereat we were
sory because we were alwaies in good hope to find some out-let
into the maine Ocean in some place of that land, and that the
same port was the same out-let, and also that by the sayd coast
we might returne to the foresayd hauen of Santa Cruz, and that
we had committed a great error, because we had not certainely
sought out the secret, whether that were a Streit or a riuer, which
wee had left behind vs vnsearched at the bottome of this great
sea or gulfe.</p>

<p>All Friday and the night following we sayled with a scant
winde, and on Saturday at breake of day we were betweene two
points of land which make a bay, wherein we saw before and
behinde foure or fiue great and small Islands. The lande was
very mountainous, part whereof was couered with grasse, and
part was voide. Within the land appeared more mountaines and
hils, and in this place we were come neere vnto the hauen of
Santa Cruz, which is all firme land, except it be diuided in the
very nooke by some streite or great riuer which parteth it from
the maine, which because we had not throughly discouered, all
of vs, that were imployed in this voyage were not a little grieued.
And this maine land stretcheth so farre in length, that I cannot
well expresse it: for from the hauen of Acapulco, which standeth
in seuenteene degrees and twentie minutes of latitude, wee had
<!--329.png-->
<span class="pagenum">333</span>
alwayes the coast of the firme land on our right
hande, vntill we came to the great current of the
white and red sea:
<span class="sidenote">This current is in 32 degrees and the sea is white
and red.</span>
and here (as I haue said) we
knew not the secret of this current, whether it were
caused by a riuer or by a streit:
<span class="sidenote">This returne is mentioned cap. 5.</span>
and so supposing that
the coast which wee had on our right hand was closed
vp without passage, wee returned backe againe,
alwayes descending Southward by our degrees, vntill
wee returned vnto the sayd hauen of Santa Cruz, finding still
along the coast a goodly and pleasant countrey, and still seeing
fires made by the Indians, and Canoas made of Canes.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> We
determined to take in fresh water at the hauen of Santa Cruz, to
runne along the outward Westerne coast, and to see what it was,
if it pleased God. Here we rested our selues, and eat of
the plummes and fruits called Pithaias: and wee entred into
the port of Santa Cruz on Sunday the 18 of October and stayed
there eight daies to take in wood and water resting our selues all
that while, that our men might strengthen and refresh themselues.
Our captaine determined to diuide amongst vs certaine garments
of taffata, with clokes and saies, and a piece of taffata, and
likewise ordained, that wee should goe on land to catch a couple
of Indians, that they might talke with our interpreter, and that we
might come to the knowledge of their language. Wherevpon
thirteene of vs went out of our ship by night, and lay in ambush
in a place which is called The well of Grijalua, where we stayed
vntill noone betweene certaine secret wayes, and could neuer see
or descrie any one Indian:
<span class="sidenote">The Spaniards vse mastiues to take the
Indians.</span>
wherefore we returned to
our ships, with two mastiue-dogs which we carried
with vs to catch the Indians with more ease: and
in our returne we found two Indians hidden in
certaine thickets, which were come thither to spie what wee did:
but because wee and our dogs were weary, and thought not on
them, these Indians issued out of the thickets, and fled away, and
wee ranne after them, and our dogges saw them not: wherefore
by reason of the thicknes of the wilde thistles, and
of the thornes and bryars, and because we were
weary, we could neuer ouertake them:
<span class="sidenote">Read more of these staues cap 10.</span>
they left behinde
them certaine staues so finely wrought that they
<!--330.png-->
<span class="pagenum">334</span>
were very beautiful to behold, considering how cunningly they
were made with a handle and a corde to fling them.</p>

This voyage up the great Gulf of California, with the discovery of the
mouth of the River Colorado, is so accurate in its details, that, with a good
map, every portion of the voyager's course can be followed.</div>

<p>The nine and twentieth of October being Wednesday, we set
sayle out of this hauen of Santa Cruz with little winde, and in
sayling downe the chanell our shippe called the Trinitie came on
ground vpon certaine sholdes: this was at noone at a low water,
and with all the remedy that we could vse wee could not draw
her off, whereupon wee were constrained to vnderprop her, and
to stay the next tide: and when the tide began to increase wee
vsed all diligence to draw her off, and could not by any meanes,
whereat all the company and the Captaine were not a little
grieued: for wee thought wee should haue lost her there,
although wee ceased not with all our might to labour with both
our boates, and with our cable and capsten. In the ende it
pleased God about midnight at a full sea with the great force
which wee vsed to recouer her, that we drew her off the
sand, for which we gaue God most hearty thankes, and
rode at anker all the rest of the night, wayting for
day light for feare of falling into any further danger
or mishap. When day was come, wee set forward with a
fresh gale, and proceeded on our voyage, directing our prows to
the maine sea, to see whether it would please God to let vs discouer
the secret of this point. But whether it pleased not his
great goodnesse, or whether it were for our sinnes, wee spent
eight dayes from this port, before we could double the poynt,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> by
reason of contrary winds, and great raine, and lightning and darknesse
euery night: also the windes grew so raging and tempestuous,
that they made us all to quake, and to pray continually
vnto God to ayde vs. And hereupon wee made our cables and
ankers ready, and the chiefe Pilot commanded vs with all speede
to cast anker, and in this sorte we passed our troubles: and
whereas wee rode in no securitie, he caused vs foorthwith to
weigh our ankers, and to goe whither the wind should driue vs.
And in this sorte wee spent those eight dayes, turning backe by
night the same way that wee had gone by day, and sometimes
making good in the night that which wee had lost in the day, not
without great desire of all the company to haue a winde which
might set vs forward on our voyage, being afflicted with the
miseries which wee indured by reason of the thunders, lightnings,
<!--331.png-->
<span class="pagenum">335</span>
and raine, wherewith we were wet from toppe to toe, by reason
of the toyle which we had in weighing and casting of our ankers,
as neede required.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a>
Cape St. Lucas.</div>

<p>And on one of these nights, which was very darke and tempestuous
with winde and raine, because we thought we should
haue perished, being very neere the shore, we prayed vnto God
that he would vouchsafe to ayde and saue vs, without calling our
sinnes to remembrance. And straightway wee saw vpon the
shrowdes of the Trinity as it were a candle, which of itselfe shined,
and gaue a light, whereat all the company greatly reioyced,
in such sort that wee ceased not to giue thankes vnto God.
Whereupon we assured our selues, that of his mercie hee would
guide and saue vs, and would not suffer vs to perish, as indeede
it fell out; for the next day wee had good weather, and all the
mariners sayd, that it was the light of Saint Elmo<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> which appeared
on the shrowdes, and they saluted it with their songs and prayers.
These stormes tooke vs betweene the Isles of Saint Iago and
Saint Philip, and the Isle called Isla de perlas lying ouer against
the point of California supposed to be firme land.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a>
St. Elmo's light, as it is called, is by no means an
unusual phenomenon. It is merely caused by the Electricity in the
air.</div>

<div class="c3">Chap. 7.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Sayling on their way they discouer a pleasant Countrey, and in
their iudgement greatly inhabited, and finde the Sea-coast
very deepe. They went to discouer or viewe the Isle of
perles. And by a current one of their ships is separated
from the other, and with great ioy after three dayes they
had sight again of her, and following their voyage they
discouer certaine great, greene, and pleasant plaines.</div>

<p>We began to sayle along the coast the seuenth or eight of
Nouember the land alwayes shewing very greene with grasse
pleasant to behold, and certaine plaines neere the shore, and vp
within the countrey many pleasant hils replenished with wood,
and certaine valleys, so that wee were delighted aboue measure,
and wondered at the greatnes and goodly view of the countrey:
and euery night we saw fires, which shewed that the countrey is
greatly inhabited.
<span class="sidenote">From hence forward they saile on the westerne or
back-side of California.</span>
Thus we proceeded on our Voyage vntill the
<!--332.png-->
<span class="pagenum">336</span>
tenth of the sayd month of Nouember, hauing alwayes
the coast of the maine Ocean on our right hand, and
the farther we sailed, wee alwayes found the countrey
more delightsome and pleasant, as well in beholding
the greennes therof, as also in that it shewed certaine
plaines and deepe valleys, through which riuers did
fall downe into the land, within certaine mountaines, and hilles
full of great woods which were not very high, and appeared
within the countrey. Here we were 54 leagues distant from
California little more or lesse, alwayes toward the Southwest,
seeing in the night three or foure fires, whereby it appeareth that
the countrey is inhabited, and full of people, for the greatnes of
the countrey argueth no lesse: and we supposed that there must
needs bee great townes inhabited within the land, although in
this poynt we were of diuers opinions. The sea is so deepe on
all this coast that we could scarce find ground in 54 fadomes.
On the greatest part of the coast there are hilles of very white
sand, and it seemeth to be a dangerous coast, because of the
great and swift tides which goe there, for the sand sheweth so
much for the space of ten or twelue leagues, for so the Pilots
affirmed.
<span class="sidenote">Isla de perlas.</span>
This day being Saturday the winde increased,
and wee had sight of the Isle of Perles,
which on this side of the gulfe appeareth with a deepe valley all
couered ouer with trees, and sheweth much fairer then on the
other side, and wee entred into the Porte of Santa Cruz. From
the ninth of Nouember to the fifteenth we sayled not aboue
tenne leagues, because we had contrary winds, and great showres;
and besides this we had another mischance which did not a little
grieue vs; for wee lost company of the ship called The Trinitie,
and could neuer see her for the space of three dayes, whereupon
wee suspected that shee was returned home vnto New Spaine, or
that she was seuered from our company: wherefore we were
grieued out of measure to see our selues so left alone, and the
Captaine of all others was most sad, though he ceased not to
encourage vs to proceede on our voyage, saying that notwithstanding
all this wee ought not to leaue off this enterprise which
we had begunne, and that though we were left alone we should
deserue the greater commendation and credite: whereupon wee
all answered him, that wee would not haue him thinke that any
of vs would euer be discouraged, but that we would follow him
vntill hee should thinke it reasonable that we should not proceede
<!--333.png-->
<span class="pagenum">337</span>
any further in the enterprise, and that we were in danger of
perishing, and that vntill then wee would bee at his commandement:
but withall we perswaded him that after he had seene any
great difficulty to proceede any further, hee should doe well to
returne backe to make relation of our successe to the R. H. lord
the Marques de Valle. Hereupon he made an Oration vnto vs
wherein he told vs, that he could not beleeue, much lesse could
imagine, wherefore the shippe called the Trinitie should returne
into Newe Spaine, nor why she should willingly depart from vs, and
goe vnto any other place, and that he thought by all reason, that
some current had caried her out of our sight, and that through
contrary weather and tempests she could not fetch vs vp, and
that notwithstanding all that which we had done in the voyage,
he had an instruction, that if by chance we were separated one
from the other, wee were to take this course to meete again
together, namely to returne backe eight or tenne leagues to seeke
one another, beyond certaine head lands which lay out into the
sea, and that therefore we should doe well to returne to seeke
her vp. This sentence pleased vs all, and so returning to seeke
her, we espied her two leagues distance from vs, comming toward
us with a fresh gale of winde, whereat we greatly reioyced.</p>

<p>Thus being come together we ankered for that day, because
the weather seemed very contrary, and the Captaine chid them
for their negligence in sayling, because they had in such
sort lost our company; and they excused themselues, that they
could doe no lesse, because a current had carried them away
aboue three leagues, whereby they could neuer reach vnto vs.
The next day being the sixteenth of Nouember wee set forward,
but sayled very little, for the North and Northwest winds were
against vs. Here we discouered certaine plaines, in my iudgement
very great and greene, and right before vs we could not
discerne any mountaines or woods, whereat wee marueiled to see
so great a countrey. And wee met an Indian in a Canoa on the
shore whereon the sea did breake, who stayed to beholde vs a
great while, and oftentimes he lifted vp himselfe to view vs the
better, and then returned backe along the coast: we vsed all
diligence to see whether he would come out further from the
shore, to giue him chase, and to try whether we could catch him,
but he very cunningly viewed vs without comming neere vnto vs,
and returned to the shore with his Canoa. Heere we saw in the
euening but one fire, and wist not whether it were done by the
<!--334.png-->
<span class="pagenum">338</span>
cunning of the Indians, because they would not haue vs know
that there were people there, or that it was so indeede. From
the said 16 day of Nouember vntill the 24 of the same moneth
we could not proceede on our way aboue 12 or 15 leagues: and
looking into our Sea-chart, we found our selues distant from the
Xaguges of the Port of Santa Cruz about 70 leagues. Now on
the 24 day being Munday very early in the morning we beganne
to take very good view of that Countrey, and all along the coast
we saw many faire plaines with certaine furrowes made in the
midst like vnto halfe plaines, the said plaine still appearing vp
into the Countrey, with pleasant champions, because the grasse
which grew there was very beautifull, short, and greene, and
good pasture for cattell. Howbeit because we rode so farre off,
we could not perfectly iudge what kind of grasse it was, but it
shewed very short and greene, and without thornes. These
plaines on the right hand made a bay into a valley which seemed
to be a piece of a mountaine: the rest shewed to be al plaines
without any thistles or weedes, but full of grasse good for cattel
very green and faire as I haue saide.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 8.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">One of their ships by tempest was separated from the other, and
afterward meeting with her consort she reporteth that the
land stretcheth to the West by the mouth of the great
lake. The Pilots are of diuers iudgements touching the
state of this coast inhabited by Chichimecas. They enter
into an hauen to take in fresh water, and are suddenly
assayled by two squadrons of Indians. They defend
themselues valiantly, and the Captaine with some of his
souldiers are grieuously wounded.</div>

<p>The 26 of this moneth being Wednesday at night the North
wind took vs, which still increased more and more so greatly that
it put vs to much trouble, for it continued two dayes, in which
the Sea was alwayes boisterous; and this night againe we lost the
Trinity being beaten with the North winde aforesaid (and we had
sight of her on Munday the 24) wherewith we were all of vs
greatly agrieued, both Captaine, Souldiers and Mariners, because
we saw we were left alone, and our ship called Santa Agueda
wherein we were, was but badly conditioned, and this grieued vs
<!--335.png-->
<span class="pagenum">339</span>
more then the trouble which we had with the boisterousnesse of
the Sea, imagining that if we should leese the Trinity, or if any
mishap should fall vnto vs, we should not be able to follow our
voyage according to our Captaines and our owne desire.
<span class="sidenote">Land running towards the Northwest.</span>
This
said 24 day being Munday we saw a Countrey with
high mountaines toward the Northwest, and it seemed
that the land stretched on still forward, whereat we
exceedingly reioyced, because we iudged that the lande grew
alwayes broader and broader, and that wee should meete with
some speciall good thing. Whereupon we desired that it would
please God to send vs good weather for our voyage, which
hitherto we found alwayes contrary, so that in 26 dayes we
sayled not aboue 70 leagues, and that with much trouble, sometimes
riding at anker and sometimes sayling, and seeking the
remedies and benefite of the shore to auoide perils. In this
Countrey which we discouered the 26 day we alwayes saw (as I
haue said) along the shore, and within the land, goodly plaines
without any tree, in the midst wherof was a lake or gathering
together of the Sea-water, which (to our iudgment) was aboue 12
leagues in compasse, and the sea-coast reached to the mountaines
before mentioned. And this day we saw our ship called the
Trinitie, which rode 2 leagues distant from vs, which so soone as
she saw vs, set saile, and we came together and reioyced greatly.
<span class="sidenote">A wonderfull fishing place like
Newfoundland.</span>
They brought vs great quantity of gray fishes, and of
another kinde: for at the point of those mountaines
they found a fishing which was very wonderfull, for
they suffered themselues to be taken by hand: and
they were so great that euery one had much adoe to finde
roome to lay his fish in. They found also on the said point a
fountaine of fresh water which descended from those hilles, and
they told vs that at the same place they had found a narrow
passage, whereby the Sea entered into the said lake. They comforted
vs much with the report of these things, and telling vs,
that the lande trended to the West; for the chiefe Pilot thought,
and the other Pilot was of the same opinion, that we shoulde finde
a good Countrey. This night we set saile to goe to that point to
take in fresh water which we wanted, and to see this lake, and to
put some men on shore; and after midnight the winde came
vpon vs so forcibly at the North that we could not stay
there: whereupon wee were constrained to put further into the
Sea, and returned the same way backe againe vnto the shore
<!--336.png-->
<span class="pagenum">340</span>
with much adoe, and came to an anker a great way short of the
place from whence we were driuen: and there we rode vntill
Thursday at noone with this bitter North winde, and on Friday
about noone, when we most thought it would haue ceased, it
beganne to increase againe, which grieued vs not a little seeing
the weather so contrary, hoping alwayes that it would cease
and that some winde would blow from the shore, whereby we
might recouer the point of land to take in fresh water, and to
search whether there were any people about that lake. Here
we lay from the 26 of the saide moneth till the 29, driuing vp
and downe the Sea, winding in by little and little vntill we had
gotten vnder the shelter of those mountaines: which being
obtayned wee rode the sayd 29 of the moneth halfe a league from
those wooddy mountaines, which we had seene in the Sea. We
stayed in this place at our ease all the Sunday, and Iuan Castilio
the chiefe Pilot went that day in the bote on shore with seuen in
his company, and they landed neere the Sea, and on a certaine
low ground they found foure or fiue Indians Chichimecas of
great stature, and went toward them, who fled away like Deere
that had beene chased. After this the Pilot went a little way
along the Sea-shore, and then returned to his boate, and by that
time he was entered thereinto, he saw about fifteen Indians of
great stature also, with their bowes and arrowes which called vnto
him with a loude and strong voice, making signes with their bowes:
but the Pilot made no account of their gesture, but rather returned
to the shippes, and declared what had passed betweene
him and the Indians. The same day the Captaine commaunded
that our caske should be made readie against the next morning
to take in water, for in both the shippes there were about fiue
and twentie buttes emptie. The first of December, and the
second day in the morning the Captaine went with both the
barkes on shore with some dozen souldiers, and the greatest part
of the Mariners which laboured in filling of water, leauing in the
shippes as many as were needefull, and as soone as we were
come on shore at the watering place the Captaine caused the
buttes to be taken out, to the ende they might be filled with
water, and while they returned to fetch the barrels and hogsheads
of the shippe, the Captaine walked a turne or two vpon the shore
for the space of one or two crossebow shoots, and afterwarde we
went vp to certaine of those mountaines, to view the disposition
of the countrey, and in trueth we found it in that place very bad
<!--337.png-->
<span class="pagenum">341</span>
to our iudgement, for it was very ragged, full of woods and caues,
and so stonie, that we had much adoe to goe. Being come vnto
the top we found certaine small hilles full of woods, and cliffes
that were not so craggie, although very troublesome to climbe
vp; and while we looked from these little hilles, we could not
discerne any more mountaines, but rather iudged that from that
place forward there were great plaines. The Captaine would not
suffer us to goe any farther, because in those places we had seene
certaine Indians which seemed to be spies, and warning vs
thereof he commanded vs to retire vnto the shore, where we were
to take in water, and to dispatch our businesse quickly, and
appointed vs to make certaine pits, that our buts might more
easily be filled with water. And setting our Guardes or Centinels,
we beganne to fill water. In the meane while the Captaine tooke
certaine souldiers, and went to the top of an high hill, from
whence he descryed a great part of the Sea, and a lake which is
within the land: for the Sea entereth in the space of a league,
and there is a good fishing place round about: and the lake was
so great, that it seemed vnto vs to be very neere 30 leagues in
compasse, for we could not discerne the end thereof. Then we
came downe with no lesse trouble then wee had mounted vp
vnto the hill, by reason of the steepenesse of the place, and
some tumbled downe with no small laughter of the rest. And
being come somewhat late to our watering place (for it was then
past noone) we set our selues to dinner, alwayes appointing some
of our company in Centinell, vntill we were called to dinner, and
when some were called two others were appointed in their
roomes.
<span class="sidenote">A sudden assalt of the Indians with stones, arrows
and staues.</span>
And about two of the clocke after dinner, the Captaine
and the rest suspecting no danger of assalt of Indians, both
because the place seemed not to be fit for it, as also for that we
had set our Centinels at the passages; two squadrons of Indians
came vpon vs very secretly and couertly, for one
came by the great valley through which the water
ranne which we tooke, and the other came by a part
of that great hill which we had ascended to see the
lake, and all of them came so couertly, that our
Centinels could neither see nor heare them; and wee had not
perceiued them, if a souldier by chance lifting vp his eyes had
not sayde, Arme, Arme, my maisters, for many Indians come
vpon vs. When we heard this the Capitane leapt vp
in a great rage, because the guards were changed out
<!--338.png-->
<span class="pagenum">342</span>
of their place: and with his sword and target, being
followed by a souldier, whose name was Haro, and afterward by
the rest, he and the said souldier went toward a little gate of
certaine stones, whither the rest of vs were to follow him: for if
the Indians had gotten that place from vs, we should haue incurred
great danger, and the greatest part of vs had like to haue
beene slaine, and none could haue escaped but such as by chance
could haue leapt into the boates, and the tide went so high, that
none could be saued but such as were most excellent swimmers.
But at length the Captaine bestirred himselfe very nimbly, vsing
all celeritie that was possible. Therefore when he and Haro had
wonne the gate, the rest of the souldiers gate vp after them, and
the Captaine and Haro turned themselues to the Indians and
made head against them, and the Indians assailed them with
such numbers of stones, arrowes, and iauelins (which was a very
strange thing) that they brake in pieces the target which the
Captaine had on his arme, and besides that wounded him with
an arrow in the bending of his knee, and though the wound was
not great, yet was it very painefull vnto him. While they thus
stood to withstand their assalt, they strooke Haro which was on
the other side so forcibly with a stone, that they threw him flat
vpon the ground: and by and by another stone lighted vpon
him which shiuered his Target, and they hit the Captaine with
another arrow, and shot him quite through one of his eares.
Another arrow came and strooke a souldier called Grauiello
Marques in the legge, of which he felt great paine and went
halting. In the meane space Francis Preciado, and certaine
other souldiers came vp and ioyned himselfe with the rest on the
left hand of the Captaine, saying vnto him, Sir, withdrawe your
selfe, for you be wounded, but be you not dismayed, for they are
but Indians and cannot hurt vs. In this wise we beganne to
rush in, among them vpon the side of a rocke alwayes gayning
ground of them, which greatly encouraged our mindes, and
when we beganne to inforce them to retire, we wanne a small
wooddy hill, where we sheltered our selues, whereas before they
shot vpon vs from aloft, for they were on the higher ground
vnder couert in safetie, and then by no meanes we could offend
them, but by running forcibly vpon them with our targets on our
armes, and our swords in our hands. On the other side,
to approach and seeke to ouertake them was a vaine
thing, seeing they were as swift as wilde goates. By this
<!--339.png-->
<span class="pagenum">343</span>
time Haro was gotten vp on foot, and hauing clapt a
woollen cloth vpon his head, which had bled extremely, he
ioyned himselfe vnto vs, of whom we receiued no small aide. In
the meane space the Indians fortified themselves on the cragge
of a rocke, from whence they did not a little molest vs, and we
likewise fortified our selues vpon an hillocke, whereby we descended
into their Fort, and there was a small valley betweene
them and vs, which was not very deepe from the vpper part.
<span class="sidenote">The Spaniards vse mastiues in their warre against
the Indians. Read more hereof cap. 12.</span>
There we were 6 souldiers and two Negroes with the Captaine,
and all of vs were of opinion that it was not good to passe that
place, least the Indians being many might destroy vs all, for the
rest of our souldiers which were beneath at the foote of the hill,
making head against the other squadron of the Indians, kept
them from hurting those which tooke in water on the strand and
from breaking the buts of water, and being but few, we concluded
to stay here, and so we stood still fortifying our selues
as well as we could, especially considering that we had no
succour on any side; for Berecillo our Mastiue-dogge which
should haue aided vs was grieuously wounded with 3 arrowes, so
that by no meanes we could get him from vs: this mastiue was
wounded in the first assault when the Indians came upon vs,
who behaued himselfe very wel, and greatly aided vs; for he set
vpon them, and put 8 or 10 of them out of array, and made them
run away, leauing many arrowes behind them: but at length
(as I haue said) he was so wounded, that by no
meanes we could get him to goe from vs to set any
more vpon the Indians, and the other two mastiues
did vs more harme then good: for when they went
against them, they shot at them with their bowes, and
we received hurt and trouble in defending them. The
Captaines legge when he waxed cold was so swolne,
that we lapped it vp in a wollen cloth, and he halted much of it:
and while the Indians thus stood still, one part of them beganne
to dance, sing and shout, and then they began all to lade them
selues with stones, and to put their arrowes into their bowes,
and to come downe toward vs verie resolutely to assalt vs, and
with great out-cries they beganne to fling stones and to shoot
their arrowes. Then Francis Preciado turned him to the Captaine
and said: Sir, these Indians know or thinke, that we
be affeard of them, and in truth it is a great falt to giue them this
encouragement, it were better for vs resolutely to set vpon them
<!--340.png-->
<span class="pagenum">344</span>
with these dogs, and to assalt them on this hill, that they may
know vs to be no dastards, for they be but Indians and dare not
stande vs; and if we can get their Fort vpon the hill, God will
giue vs victory in all the rest. The Captaine answered, that he
liked well of the motion, and that it was best so to doe, although
for any further pursuit vp the hill, he thought we were to take
another course. By and by Francis Preciado getting his target
on his arme, and his sword in his hand, ranne vnto the other side
of the valley, which on that part was not very steepe, crying S. Iago,
vpon them my masters, and after him leapt Haro, Tere&ccedil;a, Spinosa,
and a Crossebow-man called Montanno, and after them followed
the Captaine, though very lame, with a Negro and a souldier
which accompanied him, incouraging and comforting them,
willing them not to feare. Thus we draue them to the place
where they had fortified themselues, and from whence they
descended, and we tooke another hill ouer against them within a
darts cast of them. And hauing breathed our selues a little, the
Captaine came vnto vs, and said Go too my maisters, vpon them
before they strengthen themselues on this hill, for now we see
plainely that they be affeard of vs, seeing we chase them continually
from their Forts: and suddenly 3 or 4 of vs went
toward them well couered with targets, vnto the foot of their
Fort where they were assembled, and the rest of our company
followed vs: the Indians beganne to make head against vs, and
to fling many stones vpon vs, and shoot many arrowes, and we
with our swords in our hands rushed vpon them in such sort,
that they seeing how furiously we set vpon them, abandoned the
fort, and ranne downe the hill as swift as Deere, and fled vnto
another hill ouer against vs, where the other squadron of the
Indians stood, of whom they were rescued, and they began to
talke among themselues, but in a low voyce, and ioyned together
6 and 6 and 8 and 8 in a company, and made a fire and warmed
themselues, and we stood quietly beholding what they did.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 9.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">After the skirmish the Captaine being wounded, and the rest of
the souldiers seeing the Indians depart, returned vnto
their ships. The next day taking in fresh water at the
saide place he sent mariners to sound the mouth of the
lake. Departing thence they came to the port called
Baya de Sant Abad, and indured a dangerous storme at
sea. And afterward comming neere the shore to take
fresh water in the said hauen, they see certaine peaceable
Indians.</div>

<p>By this time it was late and the night approched, and the
Indians seeing this, whithin a short while after determined to get
them packing, and ech of them or the greatest part tooke firebrandes
in their hands, and got them away into craggy places.
When the Captaine saw this he commanded vs to returne aboord
our boats, it being now darke night, thanking vs all for the good
seruice we had done him. And being not able to stand vpon
his legge, he leaned with his arme vpon Francis Preciado; and
thus we returned to our boats, where with much adoe we got
aboord, by reason of the great tide and roughnesse of the sea, so
that our boats were filled with euery waue. Thus very weary,
wet, and some wounded (as is aforesaid) each man returned vnto
his ship, where our beds which we found, and our refreshing, and
the cheere we had at supper did not greatly comfort vs in regard
of our former trauels. We passed that night in this sort, and the
next day being Tuesday the Captaine found himselfe greatly
payned with his wounds, and chiefly with that on his leg, because
it was greatly swolne with his going vpon it. We lacked 12 buts
to fill with water, and the barrels in both the ships, and the
Captaine would haue gone out to cause them to be filled, but we
would not suffer him, and therefore we left off the businesse for
that day. But he appointed that the crossebowes should be
made readie, and two speciall good harquebuzes, and the next
day being Wednesday very early, he commanded Iuan Castilio
chiefe Pilot to goe out with both the botes and with all the
souldiers and mariners that he could make, hauing the day
before commanded the Trinitie to go as neere the shores as she
might, and to make ready some of her ordinance, that if the
Indians should shew themselues, they might affright them, and
<!--342.png-->
<span class="pagenum">346</span>
doe them as much hurt as they could. Wherefore on the
Wednesday al we that were souldiers, sauing the wounded persons,
went on shore with certaine mariners in the best order that we
could, and tooke the first hill, where we had fortified our selues,
standing all vpon our guard vntill the water was filled, and vntill
we were called, during which time not one Indian shewed
himselfe. Thus we went aboord when we thought good our
selues, at least without any suspition of the Indians, although the
tide of the Sea went so high that it put vs to great trouble, for
oftentimes with great waues it beat into our boats. This was on
the Wednesday the 3 of December. And to auoide losse of
time the Captaine commanded Juan Castilio the chiefe Pilot to
take a boat and certaine mariners as he should thinke good, and
to view the mouth of the lake to see whether the entrance were
deepe enough for to harbour the ships.
<span class="sidenote">A special good hauen.</span>
He taking the boat of
the Admirall with 8 mariners, and ours of the Trinity, went and
sounded the mouth, and on the shallowest place of the barre
without they found 3 fadome depth, and farther in 4,
and vp higher 5, alwayes increasing vnto 10 or 12
fadomes, when they were come into the two points
of the said lake, which was a league broad from one point to the
other, and all their sounding was exceeding good ground. Then
they went ouer to the southeast point, and there they saw a
great boat or raft which they indeuoured to take to carrie vnto
their ships. In the meane while they espied certaine cottages,
which the Pilot determined to goe and see. And being come
neere they saw 3 other raftes with 3 Indians on them distant from
the cottages one or two crossbowes shot, and he leapt on land
with 4 or 5 mariners in his companie: and while they behelde
those cottages, they saw many Indians descending downe a
small hill in warlike manner with their bowes and arrowes,
whereupon they determined to retire to their boats, and to returne
to their ships, and they were not gone from the sea-shore scarse
a stones cast, but the Indians were come vpon them to shoot
at them with their arrowes, and because they were vnarmed,
they would not fight with them, hauing gone on shore for no
other purpose, but to sound the mouth and enterance of that
lake.
<span class="sidenote">Baya del Abad is 100 leagues from the point of
California.</span>
On Thursday the 4 of December we set saile with a fresh
gale of winde, and sayled some 8 or 10 leagues, and came vnto
certaine mouthes or inlets which seemed to all of vs as though
they had beene Ilands, and we entered into one of them, and
<!--343.png-->
<span class="pagenum">347</span>
came into an hauen which we called Baya del Abad
all inclosed and compassed with land, being one of
the fairest hauens that hath beene seene: and about
the same, especially on both sides the lande was
greene and goodly to behold; we descryed certaine
riuers on that part which seemed greene, and therefore we returned
backe, going out at the mouth whereby we came in, alwayes hauing
contrary wind: yet the Pilots vsed their best indeuour to make
way: and we saw before vs certaine wooddy hils, and beyond
them certaine plaines; this we saw from the Friday the 5 of
the said moneth, vntill the Tuesday, which was the ninth. As
we drew neere to these woods they seemed very pleasant, and
there were goodly and large hilles and beyond them towardes
the sea were certaine plaines, and through all the countrey we
saw these woods.
<span class="sidenote">Many great smokes, of which also Francis Gualle
maketh mention.</span>
From the day before, which was the Conception
of our Lady, we saw many great smokes,
whereat we much maruelled, being of diuerse opinions
among our selues, whether those smokes were made
by the inhabitants of the countrey or no. Ouer
against these woods there fell euery night such a dew,
that euery morning when we rose, the decke of the
ship was so wet, that vntill the sunne was of a good height, we
alwaies made the decke durtie with going vpon it. We rode
ouer against these woods from the Tuesday morning when we set
saile, vntill Thursday about midnight, when a cruell Northwest
winde tooke vs, which, whither we would or no, inforced vs to
way our anker: and it was so great, that the ship Santa Agueda
began to returne backe, vntill her cable broke, and the ship
hulled, and suddenly with a great gust the trinket and the mizen
were rent asunder, the Northwest winde still growing more and
more: within a short while after the maine saile was rent with a
mighty flaw of winde, so that we were inforced, both souldiers,
captaine, and all of vs, to doe our best indeuor to mend our
sailes; and the Trinitie was driuen to do the like, for she going
round vpon her anker, when she came a-head of it, her cable
broke, so that there we lost two ankers, each ship one. We
went backe to seeke Baya del Abad, for we were within 20
leagues of the same, and this day we came within foure leagues
of it, and being not able to reach it by reason of contrary windes,
we rode vnder the lee of certaine mountaines and hilles which
were bare, and almost voide of grasse, neere vnto a strand full
<!--344.png-->
<span class="pagenum">348</span>
of sandie hilles. Neere vnto this road wee found a fishing place
vnder a point of land, where hauing let downe our lead to see
what ground was there, a fish caught it in his month, and began
to draw it, and he which held the sounding-lead crying and
shewing his fellowes that it was caught, that they might helpe
him, as soone as he had got it aboue the water, tooke the fish,
and loosed the cord of the sounding lead, and threw it againe into
the sea, to see whether there were any good depth, and it was
caught againe, whereupon he began to cry for helpe, and all of
vs made a shout for ioy; thus drawing the fish the rope of the
sounding-lead being very great was crackt, but at length we
caught the fish which was very faire. Here we stayed from
Friday when we arriued there, vntill the Munday, when as it
seemed good to our Captaine, that we should repaire to the
watering place, from whence we were some sixe leagues distant,
to take in 12 buttes of water, which wee had drunke and spent,
because he knew not whither we should from thencefoorth finde
any water, or no; and though we should finde water, it was
doubtfull whither wee should be able to take it by reason of the
great tide that goeth vpon that coast. We drewe neere to that
place on Munday at night, when as we sawe certaine fires of the
Indians. And on Tuesday morning our Generall commaunded
that the Trinitie should come as neere our ship and to the shore
as it could, that if we had neede, they might helpe vs with their
great ordinance: and hauing made 3 or 4 bourds to draw neere
the shore, there came 4 or 5 Indians to the sea-side; who stood
and beheld while we put out our boat and anker, marking also
how our bwoy floated vpon the water; and when our boat
returned to the ship, two of them leapt into the sea, and swamme
vnto the bwoy, and beheld it a great while; then they tooke a
cane of an arrow, and tyed to the sayd bwoy a very faire and
shining sea-oyster of pearles, and then returned to the shore,
neere to the watering place.</p>

<p><!--345.png--><span class="pagenum">349</span></p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 10.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">They giue vnto the Indians many trifles which stand vpon the
shore to see them, and seeke to parley with them by their
interpreter, which was a Chichimeco, who could not
vnderstand their language. They go to take fresh water.
Francis Preciado spendeth the time with them with many
signes, and trucking and being afeard of their great
multitude, retireth himselfe wisely with his companions,
returning with safety to the ships.</div>

<p>When the Captaine and we beheld this we iudged these
Indians to be peaceable people; whereupon the Captaine tooke
the boat with 4 or 5 mariners carrying with him certain beades
to truck, and went to speake with them. In the meane while he
commanded the Indian interpreter our Chichimeco, to be
called out of the Admirall that he should parley with them.
And the Captaine came vnto the boy, and laid certaine things
vpon it for exchange, and made signes vnto the Sauages to come
and take them; and an Indian made signes vnto our men
with his hands, his armes, and head, that they vnderstood
them not, but signified that they should go aside. Whereupon
the Captaine departed a smal distance from that place with his
boat. And they made signes againe that he should get him
further; whereupon we departing a great way off, the saide
Indians leapt into the water, came vnto the boy, and tooke those
beades, and returned backe againe to land, and then came
vnto the other three, and all of them viewing our things, they
gaue a bowe and certaine arrowes to an Indian, and sent him
away, running with all haste on the shore, and made signes
vnto vs that they had sent word vnto their lord what things
we had giuen them, and that he would come thither. Within a
while after the said Indian returned, running as he did before,
and beganne to make signes vnto vs, that his Lord was comming.
And while we stayed here, we saw on the shore ten or
twelue Indians assemble themselues, which came vnto the
other Indians, and by and by we saw another company of
12 or 15 more appeare, who assembled themselues all together.
And againe they began to make signes vnto vs, to come
<!--346.png-->
<span class="pagenum">350</span>
foorthwith to our boates, and shewed vs many Oysters of pearles
on the top of certaine canes, making signes that they would giue
them vs. When we beheld this, the Captaine commanded vs to
make readie our boate, and went aboord it with the said mariners,
and rowed to a certaine stone in forme of a rocke, which lay in
the sea neere vnto the shore. And hither came first 2 or 3
Indians, and layd downe one of those Oysters, and a garland
made of Parats feathers, or sparrowes feathers painted red; they
layd downe also certaine plumes of white feathers, and others of
blew colour. In the mean while we sawe continually Indians
assemble to the shore by tenne and tenne, and so by little and
little they came in squadrons; anyone of them assoone as hee
sawe the boat beganne to leape forward and backeward with so
great nimblenesse, that doubtlesse he seemed to all of vs a man
of great agilitie, and we tooke no small pleasure while we beheld
him fetching those gambols: but the rest of the Indians which
stood at the mouth of the fresh water ranne toward him, and
cryed vnto him, forbidding him to vse those gestures, because
we were come thither in peaceable sort, and by this meanes he
came with the rest to the watering place, where by little and
little in this manner there assembled aboue a hundred of them
all in order, with certaine staues with cordes to fling them, and
with their bowes and arrowes, and they were all painted. In
the meane while our Chichimeco interpreter borne in the Ile of
California, was come vnto vs, and the Captaine againe commanded
a mariner to strippe himselfe, and to swimme and laye
vpon the said rocke certaine belles, and more beades, and when
he had layd them there, the Indians made signes that he should
goe away; and so they came thither and tooke them, and our
men drew neere with their boat. The Captaine commanded
the Indian our Chichimeco to speake vnto them, but they could
not vnderstand him, so that we assuredly beleeue, that they
vnderstand not the language of the Ile of California. This day
being Tuesday vntil night the Indians stayed at this watering
place, taking some of our beades, and giuing vnto vs their
feathers and other things, and when it was very late they departed.
The morrow following being Wednesday very early the
Captaine commanded that our buttes should be made ready, that
before breake of day, and before the Indians should take the hill,
which stood ouer the watering place, we might be landed in good
order: which was put in execution: for we went on shore with
<!--347.png-->
<span class="pagenum">351</span>
as many as could goe, sauing those that had charge to take in
the water, and such as were to stay on ship-boord, which in all
were about fourteene or fifteene persons, in as good order as we
could deuise: for we were foure crossebowes, two harquebuziers,
and eight or nine targets, and the most part of vs carried very
good slings, and eueryone eighteene riuer stones, which weapon the
Captaine inuented, because the Indians at the first had handled vs
very shrewdly with the multitude of stones which they flang at vs:
we had nothing to defende vs sauing our targets, and to seeke to
winne the fortes from whence they indamaged vs; he therefore
thought with these slings, that we might offend them, and we,
likewise thought well of his opinion, for making tryall of them,
we threw very well with them, and much farther than we thought
we could haue done: for the slings being made of hempe, we
flung very farre with them. Nowe being come to the watering
place the sayd Wednesday by breake of day we tooke the fort of
the fountaine, which were certaine cragges or rockes hanging
ouer the same, betweene which there was an opening or deepe
valley through which this water runneth, which is no great
quantitie, but a little brooke not past a fadome broad. So
standing all in order, other foure or fiue Indians came thither,
who as soone as they sawe vs to be come on shore, and to haue
gotten the toppe of the watering place, they retired vnto a small
hill on the other side, for the valley was betweene them and vs:
neither stayed they long before they beganne to assemble themselues
as they had done the day before by 10 and 10, and 15 and
15, ranging themselues on this high hill, where they made signes
vnto vs. And Francis Preciado craued license of the Generall
to parley with these Indians, and to giue them some trifles;
wherewith he was contented, charging him not to come too
neere them, nor to goe into any place where they might hurt
him. Whereupon Francis went vnto a plaine place, vnder the
hill where the Indians stood, and to put them out of feare he
layd downe his sword and target, hauing onely a dagger hanging
downe at his girdle, and in a skarfe which he carried at his necke,
certaine beades to exchange with them, combs, fishinghooks and
comfits. And be began to goe vp the hill, and to shew them
diuerse of his merchandise. The Indians as soone as he had
layd those things on the ground, and gone somewhat aside, came
downe from the hill and tooke them, and carried them vp, for it
seemed that their Lord was among them, to whom they carried
<!--348.png-->
<span class="pagenum">352</span>
those trifles.
<span class="sidenote">Truck and traffique with the Indians for mother of
pearle, and other things.</span>
Then they came downe againe, and
layd to giue vnto him in the said place, an oyster of
pearles, and two feathers like haukes feathers, making
signes to Preciado that he should come and take
them; which he did, and againe layde there a string
of belles, and a great fishhooke, and certaine beades; and they
taking the same, layd there againe another oyster of pearle, and
certaine feathers: and he layd downe other beads, two fishhookes,
and more comfits, and the Indians came to take them vp, and
approched much neerer vnto him, then at other times, and so
neere that a man might haue touched them with a pike, and then
they began to talke together: and 7 or 8 more came downe, vnto
whom Francis Preciado made signes, that they should come
downe no lower, and they incontinently layd their bowes and
arrowes on the ground, and hauing layd them downe came somewhat
lower, and there with signes, together with them which came
first, they began to parle with him, and required mariners
breeches and apparel of him, and aboue all things a red hat pleased
them highly, which the saide Francis ware on his head, and they
prayed him to reach it vnto them, or to lay it in the place; and
after this certaine of them made signes vnto him to knowe
whether he would haue a harlot, signifying with their fingers
those villanies and dishonest actions, and among the rest they set
before him an Indian of great stature dyed wholly with black,
with certaine shels of the mother of pearle at his necke, and on
his head, and speaking by signes to Francis Preciado touching
the foresaid act of fornication, thrusting their finger through a
hole, they said vnto him, that if hee would haue a woman, they
would bring him one; and he answered, that he liked well of it,
and that therefore they should bring him one. In the meane
space on the other side where the Generall stood with his company,
another squadron of Indians shewed themselues, whereupon
the Generall and his company made a stirre, and put themselues
in battell array: whereupon Francis Preciado was inforced
to come downe from them, to ioyne with the General and his
company: and here the Indians which came last began to make
signes that we should lay downe something to truck, and that they
would giue us some of their shels of mother of pearle, which they
brought vpon certaine small stickes, and herewithall they came
very neere vnto vs, wherewith we were not well content. And
Francis Preciado said vnto the Captaine, that if it pleased him,
<!--349.png-->
<span class="pagenum">353</span>
hee would cause all the Indians to come together and to stay vpon
that high hill; and he answered, that it was best to draw them all
together, for by this time our men had taken in all their water,
and stayed for the boat: whereupon Francis taking a crowne of
beades went toward the valley, through which the water ran
toward the Indians, and made signes vnto them to call the rest,
and to come all together, because he would goe to the olde
place, to lay things on the ground for exchange, as at the first;
and they answered that he should doe so, and that they had
called the others, and that they would doe, as he would haue
them, and so they did, for they caused them to come vnto them,
which they did, and Francis likewise went alone towards them,
in which meane space the Generall commanded his people to
get into the boat. Francis comming vnto the place beganne to
lay downe his merchandise of traffique, and afterwards made
signes vnto them to stay there, because he would goe to the
ships to bring them other things, and so he returned to the place
where the Captaine was, and found them all got into the boates,
sauing the Generall and three or foure others, and the Generall
made as though he had giuen other trifles to Preciado to
carry vnto the Indians, and when he was gone a little from
him, he called him back againe, and all this while the Indians
stood still, and being come vnto him, wee went faire and softly
to our boates, and got vnto them at our ease, without any
thronging, and thence we came aboord our ship.</p>

<p>The Indians seeing vs thus gone aboord came downe to the
strand where the brooke of water was, and called vnto vs to
come foorth with our boates, and to come on shore, and to bring
our beades, and that they would giue vs of their mother of
pearles: but we being now set at dinner made no account of
them: whereupon they beganne to shoot arrowes at the ship, and
although they fell neere vs, yet they did not reach vs.
In the meane season certaine mariners went out in the
boat, to wey the anker, whereupon the Indians seeing them
comming towards them, and bringing them nothing, they beganne
in scorne to shew them their buttockes, making signes that they
should kisse their bums: and these seemed to be those that
came last. The Generall seeing this, commanded a musket to
be once or twise shot off, and that they should take their iust
ayme. They seeing these shot to be made readie, some of them
rose and went to shoot their arrowes at our mariners, which were
<!--350.png-->
<span class="pagenum">354</span>
gone to weigh the ankers, then the Generall commanded the
great ordinance speedily to be shot off, whereupon three or foure
bullets were discharged, and we perceiued that we had slaine one
of them, for we assuredly saw him lye dead vpon the shore: and
I thinke some of the rest were wounded. They hearing this
noyse, and seeing him dead ranne away as fast as euer they could,
some along the shore, and some through the vallies, dragging the
dead Indian with them, after which time none of them appeared,
saue ten or twelue, which peeped vp with their heads among
those rocks; whereupon another piece of ordinance was discharged
aloft against the place where they were, after which time we
neuer saw any more of them.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">At the point of the Trinitie they spend three dayes in fishing,
and in other pastimes: after which setting sayle they
discouer pleasant countries, and mountaines voide of
grasse, and an Iland afterward called Isla de los Cedros,
or the Ile of Cedars, neere which they suffer sharpe colde
and raine, and to saue themselues they returne thither.</div>

<p>Immediatly we set saile to ioyne with the ship Santa Agueda,
which was aboue halfe a league in the high sea from vs, and this
was on the Wednesday the seuenteenth of December. Being
come together because the windes were contrary, we drew neere
to a headland, which wee called Punta de la Trinidad, and here
wee stayed fishing, and solacing our selues two or three dayes,
although we had alwayes great store of raine. Afterward we
beganne to sayle very slowly, and at night we rode ouer against
those mountaines where we had left our ankers, and vpon knowledge
of the place we receiued great contentment seeing we had
sailed some fiue and thirtie leagues from the place where we had
taken in water: neither was it any maruell that wee so reioyced,
because that the feare which we had of contrary windes caused vs
to be so well appayd of the way which we had made. The day
of the holy Natiuitie of our Lord, which was on the Thursday the
fiue and twentieth of the said moneth, God of his mercy beganne
to shew vs fauour in giuing vs a fresh winde almost in the
poope, which carried vs beyond those mountaines, for the space
of tenne or twelue leagues, finding the coast alwayes plaine: and
<!--351.png-->
<span class="pagenum">355</span>
two leagues within the land, which we coasted along, and betweene
these mountaines, there was a great space of plaine
ground, which we might easily discerne with our eyes, although
others were of another opinion. We beganne from Christmas
day to saile slowly with certaine small land-windes, and sayled
from morning to night and about seuen or eight leagues, which
wee esteemed no small matter, alwayes praying to God to continue
this his fauour toward vs, and thanking him for his holy
Natiuitie, and all the dayes of this feast the Frier sayd masse in
the Admirall, and the father Frier Raimund preached vnto vs,
which gaue vs no small comfort, by incouraging vs in the seruice
of God.</p>

<p>On Saturday at night being the 27. of the said moneth we
ankored neere vnto a point which seemed to be plaine land all
along the shore, and within the countrey were high mountaines
with certaine woods, which woods and mountaines ranne ouerthwart
the countrey, and continued along with certaine small
hilles sharpe on the toppe, and certaine little vallies are betweene
those mountaines.
<span class="sidenote">Great appearance of gold and siluer.</span>
And in truth, to me which with diligent eyes
beheld the same both in length and in the breadth thereof, it
could not chuse but be a good countrey, and to haue great
matters in it, as well touching the inhabiting thereof by the
Indians, as in golde and siluer; for there was great
likelihood that there is store thereof. This night we
saw a fire farre within the lande towards those mountaines,
which made vs thinke that the countrey was
throughly inhabited. The next day being Sunday and Innocents
day, the 28 of the said moneth, at breake of day we set sayle,
and by nine or ten of the clocke had sayled three or foure
leagues, where we met with a point which stretched towarde the
West, the pleasant situation whereof delighted vs much. From
the eight and twentieth of December we ranne our course vntill
Thursday being Newyeares day of the yeere 1540, and we ran
some 40 leagues, passing by certaine inlets and bayes, and
certaine high mountains couered with grasse in colour like
rosemary: but toward the sea-side very bare and burned, and toward
the top were certaine cragges somewhat of a red colour, and
beyond these appeared certaine white mountaines, and so all the
countrey shewed vnto a point which appeared beyond those
burnt white and red mountaines which haue neither any grasse
nor tree vpon them, whereat we maruelled not a little. This
<!--352.png-->
<span class="pagenum">356</span>
Newyeares day we sawe neere the maine two small Ilands, and
reioyced greatly to see them; for we stood in great feare, that
contrary windes would driue vs as farre backe in one day, as we
had sayled in tenne, which if they had taken vs, we could not
haue withstood them. Wee ranne from the first of Ianuary
untill Munday which were fiue dayes, and the land alwayes
stretched Northwest from the mountaines aforesaid.</p>

<p>And on the Sunday we saw a farre off a-head of vs a high land
somewhat seuered from the maine shore, and all of vs beganne
to dispute whether it were the land which trended toward the
Northwest, for that way the Pilots hoped to discouer a better
countrey: and the said Munday the fift of Ianuarie we came to
this high land beforesaid, and it was two Ilands the one a small
one and the other a great one: we coasted these two Ilands some
sixe leagues, which were greene, and had on the toppe of them
many high slender trees; and the great Iland was twentie leagues
in compasse.
<span class="sidenote">Isla de los Cedros mentioned in the <a
href="#Chap_13">13 chap.</a></span>
We coasted in 6 leagues in length
without seeing or discouering any other things, but
we saw before vs high land which stretched eight or
tenne leagues Northward, where we rode on Munday
at night. From Thursday being Newyeares day vntill the next
Munday we sayled about 35 leagues.
<span class="sidenote">The land trendeth here Northwest 35
leagues.</span>
And in this
course we felt great cold, which grieued vs much,
especially being assailed by two or three windie
showers, which pinched vs much with colde. We
rode ouer against this land two or three nights, hauing it
neere vnto vs, alwayes keeping watch by equall houres,
one while mariners, and another souldiers, all the night
long with great vigilancie. On Tuesday being Twelfe day
we came within two or three leagues of this land, which
we had descryed the day before, seeming to vs very pleasant for
it shewed greene with greene trees of an ordinary bignesse, and
we saw many vallies, out of which certaine small mists arose,
which continued in them for a long time, whereupon we gathered
that they rose out of certaine riuers. The same morning, to our
great comfort we saw great smokes, though we were about foure
leagues distant from them, and the Captaine made no great
reckoning to approach neere vnto them, nor to seeke nor serch
what the matter was, and perchance because he was not then in the
Santa Agueda, but was aboord the Trinitie, as his maner was to
come and stay there two or three dayes, as well to passe the time,
<!--353.png-->
<span class="pagenum">357</span>
as to giue order for things that were needfull. In this countrey
the winter and raine seemed to be like that of Castile. We
rode al night two or three leagues distance from shore,
and toward euening we saw fiue or sixe fires,
whereat we all reioyced, but did not maruell thereat, because
the situation of that countrey shewed to be habitable, being farre,
pleasant, and all greene, and likewise because the Iland which we
had left behinde vs being (as I haue said) twenty leagues in
circuit, made shewe that it was well peopled. On the Wednesday
we were 3 or 4 leagues at sea from the land, and began to
see two fires more, and therefore we assured our selues that the
countrey was very well inhabited; and the farther we sayled, we
alwayes found it more ciuill.
<span class="sidenote">Floting weeds for fifty leagues.</span>
And for the space of
fifty leagues before we came hither we alwayes found
swimming on the sea certaine flotes of weedes of a
ships length, and of the bredth of two ships, being,
round and full of gourds, and vnder these weedes were many
fishes, and on some of them were store of foules like vnto white
sea-meawes. We supposed that these floting weeds did grow
vpon some rocke under the water. We were now in 30 degrees
of Northerly latitude.
<span class="sidenote">Twenty leagues beyond the Ile of Cedar.</span>
We sailed from the 7 of Ianuary vntill the
9 still with contrary windes: and on Fryday about noone there
rose a North and Northeastern winde, which forced
vs to returne vnder the shelter of that Iland which
we left behind vs, from whence we had sayled about
twentie leagues. And that Friday at night somewhat
late we had sayled backe about twelue leagues of the
same, and because it was night wee stayed in the sea, where we
and our shippes were not a little troubled, so that all that night
none of vs slept a winke, but watched euery one. The next
morning betimes being Saturday we proceeded on our voyage,
and gate vnder the shelter of the said Iland, riding in thirtie
fadome water: and on that side where we ankored we found
high and closed mountaines, with heapes of a certaine earth
which was all ashes and burned, and in other places skorched
and as blacke as coles, and like the rust of yron, and in other
places whitish, and here and there small blacke hilles, whereat
we maruelled exceedingly, considering that when we passed by,
it seemed vnto vs an habitable countrey full of trees, and now
we saw not a sticke growing on this side.</p>

<p>All of vs supposed that on the other side toward the firme
<!--354.png-->
<span class="pagenum">358</span>
lande the trees grewe which we sawe, although (as I haue sayde)
wee sayled foure or fiue leagues distant from the same.</p>

<p>We stayed here vnder the shelter of these mountaines Saturday,
Sunday, and Munday, alwayes hauing the Northren winde so
strong, that we thinke if it had caught vs in the sea, wee should
haue bene cast away.</p>

<div class="c3"><a id="Chap_12"></a>Chap. 12.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">They enuiron and land vpon the Iland of Cedars, to discouer the
same, and to seeke water and wood. They are assailed
of the Indians, and many of them wounded with stones:
but at length getting the vpper hand, they goe to their
cottages, and ranging farther vp into the Iland they find
diuerse things which the Indians in their flight had left
behind them.</div>

<p>On Friday the 13 of Ianuary the Captaine commanded vs to
hoise out our boates, and to goe on shore, which was done
accordingly, and we did row along the shore for the space of
a good halfe league and entered into a valley: for (as I said) all
this countrey was full of high and bare hils, of such qualitie
as I mentioned before: and in this and other small valleys we
found some water which was brackish, and not farre from thence
certaine cottages made of shrubs like vnto broome: likewise we
found the footings of Indians both small and great; whereat we
much maruelled that in so rough and wilde a countrey (as farre
as we could discerne) there should be people. Here we stayed
all day, making foure or fiue pits to take in water which we
wanted, which though it were bad, and in small quantitie we
refused not; and so the euening being come, we returned to our
boates, and so came vnto our ships which rode a good league
from the shore. The next day being Wednesday the fourteenth
of the said moneth our Generall commanded vs to set saile, and
we sailed about the said Iland on the same side which we coasted
when we came from Nueua Espanna: for when we arriued on
the coast we saw fiue or sixe fires; wherefore he desired to see
and learne whether it were inhabited; and at the farthest ende
of this inlet or bay where we rode there came out before vs a
Canoa, wherein were foure Indians which came rowing with
certaine small oares, and came very neere vs to see what we were:
<!--355.png-->
<span class="pagenum">359</span>
whereupon we tolde our Generall, that it were best to send some
of vs out with our boates to take these Indians or some one of
them to giue them something that they might thinke vs to be good
people: but hee would not consent thereto, because he minded
not to stay, hauing then a prety gale of winde, whereby he
might saile about this Iland, hoping that afterward we
might finde and take some others to speake with them, and
giue them what we would to carry on shore; and as we
sayled neere the land, we saw a great hill full of goodly trees of
the bignesse of the trees and Cypresses of Castile. We
found in this Iland the footing of wilde beasts and conies,
and saw a peece of pine tree-wood, wherof we gathered, that
there was store of them in that countrey. Thus sayling neere
vnto the shore, we sawe another Canoa comming toward vs with
other foure Indians, but it came not very neere vs, and as we
looked forward, we sawe toward a point which was very neere
before vs, three other Canoas, one at the head of the point among
certaine flattes, and the other two more into the sea, that they
might descry vs without comming ouer neere vs. Likewise
betweene certaine hilles which were neere the point, there
appeared here three and there foure of them, and afterward we
saw a small troope of some twentie of them together, so that all
of vs reioyced greatly to behold them. On this side the land
shewed greene with pieces of plaine ground which was neere the
sea, and likewise all those coasts of hils shewed greene, and
were couered with many trees, although they grew not very
thicke together. Here at euening we rode neere the shore
hard vpon the said point, to see if we could speake with
those Indians, and likewise to see if we could get fresh
water, which now we wanted, and still as soone as we were
come to an anker, we saw the Indians shew themselues on
land neere vnto their lodgings, comming likewise to descry vs in
a Canoa, by sixe and seuen at a time, whereat we maruelled,
because we neuer thought that one of those Canoas would hold
so many men. In this wise we stayed looking still what would
be the successe, and in the place where we rode we were two
small leagues distant from the shore, where we found these Indians
in their Canoas: whereupon we maruelled not a little to see so
great an alteration in so small a distance of countrey, as well
because we still discouered pleasant land with trees (whereas on
the other side of the isle there were none) as also because it
<!--356.png-->
<span class="pagenum">360</span>
was so well peopled with Indians, which had so many Canoas
made of wood, as we might discerne, and not raftes or Balsas,
for so they call those floats which are made all flat with canes.</p>

<p>The next day being Thursday the fifteenth of the said moneth
about breake of day foure or fiue Indians shewed themselues at
the head of that point, who as soone as they had spyed vs retired
behind the point, and hid themselues among the bushes vpon
certaine small hilles that were there, from whence they issued
forth, and couered all the greene hils and mountaines, which were
along that coast; whereupon we gathered that they had their
dwellings there, in regard of the commoditie of the water and the
defence against ill weather and the benefite of fishing. At sun-rising
we saw the Indians appeare in greater companies, going vp
vnto the hilles in small troopes, and from thence they stood and
beheld vs. Immediately we saw fiue or sixe Canoas come out
into the sea a good distance from vs, and those which were in
them stood often on their tip-toes, to view and descry vs the
better. On the other side we stirred not at all for all these their
gestures, but stood still riding at anker; and the Generall seemed
not to be very willing to take any of them, but this day in the
morning very early commanded the Masters mate to conueigh
him to our other shippe called the Trinitie. Things passed in
this sort, when about ten of the clocke we saw three Canoas lanch
farre into the sea to fish very neere vnto vs, whereat we tooke
greate pleasure. At 12 of the clocke the Generall returned from
the Trinitie and commanded the boat and men to be made readie,
as well souldiers as mariners, and that we should goe on shore
to see if we could get any wood and water, and catch one of
those Indians to vnderstande their language if it were possible:
and so all the men that were readie went into the Admirals
boate, and went toward the Trinitie which by this time
with the other ship had a small gale of winde, wherewith
they entered farther within the point, and we discouered
the lodgings and houses of the Indians, and saw neere
the waters side those fiue or sixe Canoas which at the first came
out to view vs, drawen on shore, and ouer against this
place the ships cast anker in 30 and 35 fadome water, and we
were very neere the land: whereat we maruelled much to find so
great depth of water so neere the shore. Being gone abord our
botes, we made toward the shore ouer against a village of
the Indians, who as soone as they saw vs about to come on
<!--357.png-->
<span class="pagenum">361</span>
land, left an hill whereon they stood to behold what we did, and
came downe to the shore, where we were prepared to come on
land: but before they came against vs they caused their women
and children to fly into the mountaines with their goods, and then
came directly towards vs, threatning vs with certaine
great staues which they carried in their hands some
3 yardes long and thicker then a mans wrest:
<span class="sidenote">A skirmish of the Indians fighting with
stones.</span>
but perceiuing that for all this we ceased not to come
neere the sea-shore to come on land, they began to charge vs
with stones and to fling cruelly at vs, and they hit 4 or 5
men, among whom they smote the Generall with two stones. In
the meane while the other bote landed a little beneath, whereupon
when they saw that they were forced to diuide themselves to
keepe the rest of our company from comming on land, they
began to be discouraged, and did not assaile the Generals boate
so fiercely, who began to cause his people to goe on shore with
no small trouble; for albeit he was neere the land, yet as soone
as they leapt out of the boat they sunke downe, because they
could find no fast footing; and thus swimming or otherwise as
they could, first a souldier called Spinosa got on land, and next
to him the General, and then some of the rest, and began to
make head against the Indians, and they came hastily with those
staues in their hands, for other kinds of weapons we saw none,
sauing bowes and arrowes of pinetree.
<span class="sidenote">The great vse of targets against arrowes or
stones.</span>
After a short combate
they brake in pieces the targets of the Generall, and of Spinosa.
In the meane while those of the other boat were gotten on land,
but not without much difficultie, by reason of the multitude of
stones which continually rained downe vpon them, and they
stroke Terazzo on the head a very shrowd blow, and had it not
bene for our targets, many of vs had beene wounded,
and in great distresse, although our enemies were
but few in number. In this maner all our company
came on shore with swimming and with great difficultie,
and if they had not holpen one another, some of
them had bene drowned. Thus we landed, and within a while
after those of the other bote were come on land, the Indians
betooke themselues to flight, taking their way toward the
mountaines, whether they had sent their women, children and
goods: on the other side we pursued them, and one of those
Indians which came to assaile the Generals boat, was slaine
vpon the strand, and two or three others were wounded, and
<!--358.png-->
<span class="pagenum">362</span>
some said more.
<span class="sidenote">The vse of mastiues in the warre against
Indians.</span>
While we pursued them in this maner our mastiue
dogge Berecillo ouertooke one of them not farre from vs (who
because we were so wet could not run very fast) and
pulled him downe, hauing bitten him cruelly, and
doubtlesse he had held him till we had come, vnlesse
it had happened that another of his companions had
not followed that Indian which the dogge had pulled
downe, who with a staffe which he had in his hands gaue the
dogge a cruell blow on the backe, and without any staying drew
his fellow along like a Deere, and Berecillo was faine to leaue
him for paine; neither had he scarse taken the dogge off on him
but the Indian got vp, and fled so hastily towarde the mountaine,
that within a short while hee ouertooke his fellowe which had
saued him from the pawes of the dogge, who (as it appeared)
betooke him lustily to his heeles, and thus they came vnto their
fellowes which descended not downe to the shore being about
some twentie, and they were in all about fiftie or sixtie.</p>

<p>After we had breathed our selues a while, we viewed their
houses where they stood, which were certaine cottages couered
with shrubs like broome and rosemary, with certaine stakes
pight in the ground; and the Generall willed vs to march all
together without dispersing of our selues, a little way vp those
mountaines, to see if there were any water and wood, because
we stood in great neede of them both. And while we marched
forward, we saw in certaine little vallies the goods which the
women had left there behind them in their flight: for the Indians
as soone as they saw vs pursue them ouertooke the women, and
for feare charged them to flie away with their children leauing
their stuffe in this place. We went vnto this booty, and found
good store of fresh-fish, and dried fish, and certaine bags containing
aboue 28 pound weight full of dried fish ground to
pouder, and many seal skins, the most part dressed with a faire
white graine vpon them, and others very badly dressed. There
were also their instruments to fish withall, as hookes made of the
prickes of certaine shrubs and trees. Here we tooke the said
skins without leauing any one in the place, and then we returned
to the sea, because it was now night, or at least very late, and
found our botes waiting for vs.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">A description of the Canoas of the Indians of the Ile of Cedars,
and how coasting the same to find fresh water they found
some, and desiring to take thereof they went on shore,
and were diuersely molested with the weapons of the
Indians. They christen an old Indian, and returne vnto
their ships.</div>

<p>The Canoas which they had were certaine thicke trunkes of
Cedars, some of them of the thicknesse of two men, and three
fadome long, being not made hollow at all, but being laid along
and fastened together, they shoue them into the sea, neither were
they plained to any purpose, for we found no kind of edge-toole,
sauing that there were certaine sharp stones, which we found
vpon certaine rockes that were very keene, wherewith we
supposed that they did cut and flea those seales. And neere the
shore we found certaine water, wherewith we filled certaine
bottles made of the skins of those seales, contayning ech of them
aboue a great paile of water. The next day our Generall
commanded vs to set saile, whereupon sailing with a fresh gale
about 2 leagues from the shore of this Island, trending about the
same to see the end thereof, and also to approch neere the firme
land, to informe our selues of the state thereof, because we had
seene 5 or 6 fires we compassed the same about: for by this
meanes we performed 2 or three good actions, namely, we
returned to our right course, and searched whether any riuer fell
out of the coast of the firme land, or whether there were any trees
there, or whether any store of Indians did shew themselues or no.</p>

<p>In this maner proceeding on our way all the Friday being the
16 of January at euening, and seeking to double the point of the
Iland, so fierce and contrary a Northren winde encountered vs,
that it draue vs backe that night ouer against the lodgings and
habitations of the Indians, and here we stayed all Saturday,
what time we lost the Trinitie againe, but on Sunday-night being
the 18 we saw her againe, and beganne to proceede on our way
to compasse that Iland, if it pleased God to send vs good
weather.</p>

<span class="sidenote">Isla de los Cedros, or the Ile of Cedars in 28 deg.
and a quarter.</span>
On Sunday, Munday, and Tuesday (which was the twentieth,
<!--360.png-->
<span class="pagenum">364</span>
of the said moneth of Ianuarie) wee sailed with scarce and contrary
windes, and at length came to the cape of the
point of the Iland, which we called Isla de los Cedros
or the Ile of Cedars, because that on the tops of the
mountaines therein, there growes a wood of these
Cedars being very tall, as the nature of them is to be.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
This day the Trinitie descryed a village or towne of the Indians,
and found water: for on Sunday night we had newly lost her,
and had no sight of her vntill Tuesday, whenas we found her
riding neere the shore, not farre from those cottages of the Indians.
And as soone as we had descryed her, we made toward her, and
before we could reach her, we espied three Canoas of Indians
which came hard aboord the said ship called the Trinitie, so that
they touched almost the side of the ship, and gaue them of their
fish, and our people on the other side gaue them certaine trifles
in exchange, and after they had spoken with them, the Indians
went backe to the shore, and at the same instant we came vp
vnto the Admirall and rode by them, and they all saluted vs,
saying that the Indians were neere them, and telling what had
passed betweene them, whereat the Generall and we receiued
great contentment. They told vs moreouer, that they had
found fresh water, whereby they increased our great ioy, because
we stood in much neede thereof, for at the other place of the
Indians we could get but a little.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a>
The Island still bears this name.</div>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">These mighty deepe and high weedes are described in
the end of this treatise.</span>
While we thus rode at ankor, we saw a Canoa with 3 Indians
put out into the sea from their cottages, and they
went vnto a fishing place, among certaine great and
high weedes, which grow in this sea among certaine
rockes, the greatest part of which weedes groweth in
15 or 20 fadome depth; and with great celeritie they
caught seuen or eight fishes, and returned with them vnto the
Trinity, and gaue them vnto them, and they in recompense gaue
the Indians certaine trifles. After this the Indians stayed
at the sterne of the ship, viewing the same aboue three houres
space, and taking the oares of our boat they tryed how they
could rowe with them, wherat they tooke great pleasure; and we
which were in the Admirall stirred not a whit all this while, to
giue them the more assurance, that they should not flie away,
but should see that we ment to do them no harme, and that we
<!--361.png-->
<span class="pagenum">365</span>
were good people. As soone as we were come to anker, and
beheld all that had passed betweene the Indians and those of the
Trinity, after the Indians were gone to the shore in their Canoas
made of the bodies of trees, the Generall commanded the boat
which was without to be brought vnto him: and when it was
come, he, and Francis Preciado, and two others went into it,
and so we went aboord the Trinity. The Indians seeing
people commingout of the other ship into the Trinitie, sent two
Canoas vnto the sterne of the ship, and brought vs a bottle of water
and we gaue vnto them certain beads, and continued talking with
them a little while; but euening approching the aire grew somewhat
cold. The Indians returned on shore to their lodgings, and
the General and we to our ship. The next day being Wednesday
in the morning, the General commanded certaine of vs to take
the bote and goe ashore, to see if we could find any brooke or
well of fresh water in the houses of the Indians, because he
thought it impossible for them to dwell there without any water
to drinke. The father frier Raimund likewise went out in our
company, because the day before seeing the Indians came to the
sterne of the shippe parlying with vs, he thought he might
haue spoken a little with them, with the like familiarity. In like
sort many mariners and souldiers went out in the boat of the
Trinity, and going altogether with their weapons toward the
shore, somewhat aboue the lodgings of the Indians, very early in
the morning they watched the boats, and perceiued that we
would come on land, wherevpon they sent away their women and
children with certaine of them, who caried their goods vp into
certaine exceeding steepe mountaines and hilles, and 5 or 6 of
them came toward vs, which were excellently well made, and of
a good stature. Two of them had bowes and arrowes, and other
two 2 bastonadoes much thicker then the wrist of a mans hand,
and other two with 2 long staues like iauelins with very sharpe
points, and approched very neere vs being nowe come on shore.
And beginning by signes very fiercely to braue vs, they came so
neere vs, that almost they strooke with one of those staues one
of our souldiers called Garcia a man of good parentage, but the
General commanded him to withdraw himselfe, and not to hurt
any of them. In the meane season the General and frier
Raimund stept foorth, the frier lapping a garment about his
arme, because they had taken vp stones in their hands, fearing
that they would do them some mischiefe. Then began both of
<!--362.png-->
<span class="pagenum">366</span>
them to speake vnto them by signes and words, to be quiet,
signifying, that they ment them no harme, but only were come to
take water; and the frier shewed them a drinking cup; but
nothing would serue to make them leaue that bragging and flinging
of stones; and the General continuing still in a mind not to
hurt them, commanded his men gently to come neere vnto them,
and that by signes they should all shew them, that they meant in
no wise to hurt them, but that we were come on land onely
to take water.
<span class="sidenote">The great vse of mastiues in pursuit of the
Indians.</span>
On the other side refusing vtterly to take knowledge
of these things they still insulted more and more: whereupon
Francis Preciado counselled the General to giue him leaue
to kill one of them, because all the rest would flee away, wherby
at our ease we might take water: but he replied that he
would not haue it so, but willed them to looze the two
mastiues Berecillo and Achillo: wherefore the dogs were let
loose, and as soone as they saw them, they vanished
immediately, betaking them to their heels, and running
vp those cliffes like goates. Also others which
came from the mountains to succour them, betooke
themselues to flight. The dogs ouertooke two of them, and bit
them a little, and we running after, laid hold on them, and they
seemed as fierce as wild and vntamed beasts for 3 or 4 of vs
held either of them, to cherish and pacifie them, and to seeke to
giue them some thing: but we auailed not, for they bit vs by the
hands, and stooped downe to take vp stones for to strike vs with
them. We led them a while in this maner, and came vnto their lodgings,
where the Generall gaue a charge, that no man should
touch any thing of theirs, commanding Francis Preciado to see
that this order was observed, in not taking any thing from them,
although in very deed there was little or nothing there, because
the women and Indians which were fled had caried al away.
Here we found an old man in a caue so extreamly aged as it was
wonderful, which could neither see nor go, because he was so
lame and crooked. The father frier Raimund sayd, it were good
(seeing he was so aged) to make him a Christian; whereupon we
christened him. The captaine gaue the Indians which we had
taken two paire of eare-rings, and certaine counterfeit diamonds,
and making much of them, suffered them to depart at their
pleasure, and in this sort faire and softly they returned to the
rest of their fellowes in the mountaine. We tooke the matter of
that village which was but a small quantity, and then the
<!--363.png-->
<span class="pagenum">367</span>
Generall commanded vs to resume to our ship, because we had
eaten nothing as yet, and after our repast we sayled towards a
bay which lay beyond that village, where we saw a very great
valley, and those of the Trinitie sayd, that they had seene there
good store of water, and sufficient for vs; wherefore wee ankered
neere vnto that valley. And the Generall went on shore with
both the boates, and the men that went on land in the morning
with the two fathers frier Raimund, and frier Antony: and passing
vp that valley a crossebow shot, we found a very small brooke of
water which neuertheless supplied our necessity for we filled two
buts thereof that euening, leauing our vessels to take it with on
shore vntill the next morning: and we reioyced not a little that
we had found this water, for it was fresh, and the water which we
had taken vp before was somewhat brackish, and did vs great
hurt both in our bodies and in our taste.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">They take possession of the Isle of Cedars for the Emperours

<p>The next day being the two and twentieth of Ianuary very
early the General commanded vs to go on shore, and that we
should haue our dinner brought vs, and should take in the rest of
our water, which we did, and filled 17 buts without seeing any
Indian at al. The next day going out to fill 8 or 9 vessels
which were not yet filled, a great winde at Northwest tooke vs,
whereupon they made signes to vs from the ships, that with all
haste wee should come on board againe, for the wind grew
still higher, and higher, and the Masters were affraid that our
cables would break, thus we were in the open sea.
<span class="sidenote"><a href="#Chap_12">Chap. 12.</a></span>
Therefore being come aboord againe not without
great trouble we returned backe ouer against the village of the
Indians, where we had slaine the Indian, and because the
wind grew more calme about midnight, the Pilots did not cast
anker,
<span class="sidenote">Isle de los Cedros is the greatest of the 3 Isles
of S. Stephan.</span>
but hulled vnder the shelter of this Island, which (as I
<!--364.png-->
<span class="pagenum">368</span>
haue said) is called The Isle of Cedars, and is one of
the 3 Isles of. S. Stephan, the greatest and chiefest of
them, where the General tooke possession. While
we hulled here, about midnight, the next Friday
being the 23 of the moneth, without our expectation
we had a fresh gale of wind from the Southeast, which was very
fauourable for our voyage, and the longer it continued, the more
it increased; so that betweene that night and the
next day being Saturday the 24 of the said moneth
we sailed 18 great leagues.
<span class="sidenote">Read cap. 11 about the end.</span>
While we were thus on
our way, the winde grew so contrary and so tempestuous,
that to our great grief we were constrained
to coast about with our ships, and returned twenty
leagues backe againe, taking for our succour the second time,
the point of the lodgings of the Indians, where the foresayd
Indian was slaine, and here we stayed Munday, Tewsday, and
Wednesday, during which time the Northwest and the North
wind blew continually, whereupon we determined not to stirre
from thence vntill we saw good weather, and well setled for our
voyage: for in this climate these winds doe raigne so greatly,
that we feared they would stay vs longer there then we would;
and we were so weary of staying, that euery day seemed a
moneth vnto vs. Vnder this shelter we rode Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday vntill noone, which was the last of Ianuary in the
yeere 1540. About noone the wind began to blow softly at
Southwest, whereupon the General told the Pilots, that we
should doe well to put ouer to the maine land, where with some
wind off the shore we might by the grace of God
saile somewhat farther. Thus we hoised our sailes,
and sailed vntil euening three or foure leagues, for the wind
scanted, and wee remained becalmed.
<span class="sidenote">February.</span>
The night being come
there arose a contrary winde, and we were inforced of necessitie
to retire the third time to the same shelter of the Isle of Cedars,
where we stayed from the first of February vntil Shrouesunday,
in the which meane time we tooke in two buts of water which
we had spent. During the space of these eight dayes we sought
to make sayle two or three times, but as we went out a little
beyond the point of this Isle, we found the wind so boystrous
and contrary, and the sea so growen, that of force we were
constrained to returne vnder the succour of the Island,
and often times wee were in great feare that we should not
<!--365.png-->
<span class="pagenum">369</span>
be able to get in thither againe. During this time that we could
not proceed on our iourney, we imployed our selues in catching
a few fishes for the Lent. From Shrouesunday being the 8 of
February, on which day we set sayle, we sayled with a
very scant wind, or rather a calme, vntil Shrouetewsday, on
which we came within kenne of the firme land, from whence we
were put backe these twenty leagues (for in these two dayes and
a halfe wee sayled some 20 small leagues) and we lay in sight
of the said poynt of the firme land. And on the Tewsday we
were becalmed, waiting till God of his mercy would helpe vs with
a prosperous wind to proceed on our voyage.</p>

<p>On Shrouesunday at night, to make good cheere withall wee
had so great winde and raine, that there was nothing in our
ships which was not wet, and very colde ayre. On Ashwednesday
at sun-rising we strooke saile neere a point which we fel
somewhat short withall in a great bay running into this firme
land: and this is the place where we saw fiue or sixe fires, and
at the rising of the sunne being so neere the shore that we might
well descrie and viewe it at our pleasure we saw it to bee very
pleasant, for wee descried as farre as wee could discerne with our
eyes, faire valleys and small hilles, with greene shrubs very
pleasant to behold, although there grew no trees there. The
situation shewed their length and breadth. This day was little
winde, it being in a manner calme, to our no small griefe: and
the father frier Raimund sayd vs a drie masse, and gaue vs
ashes, preaching vnto vs according to the time and state wherein
we were: with which sermon we were greatly comforted.
<span class="sidenote">The point of Santa Cruz otherwise called Punta de
Balenas.</span>
After
noonetide we had contrary wind, which still was our enemie in
all our iourney, at the least from the point of the
port of Santa Cruz. Here we were constrained to
anker in fiue fadome of water, and after wee rode
at anker wee began to viewe the countrey, and tooke
delight in beholding how goodly and pleasant it was,
and neere vnto the sea wee iudged that wee saw a valley of white
ground. At euening so great a tempest came vpon vs of winde
and raine, that it was so fearfull and dangerous a thing that a
greater cannot be expressed: for it had like to haue driuen vs
vpon the shore, and the chiefe Pilot, cast out another great
anker into the sea yet all would not serve, for both these ankers
could not stay the ship. Whereupon all of vs cryed to God for
mercy, attending to see how he would dispose of vs; who of his
<!--366.png-->
<span class="pagenum">370</span>
great goodnesse, while we were in this danger, vouchsafed a
little to slake the tempest, and with great speede the chief Pilot
commanded the mariners to turne the capsten, and the Generall
commanded and prayed all the souldiers to helpe to turne the
capsten, which they were nothing slow to performe: and thus we
beganne to weigh our ankers, and in weighing of one which was
farre greater then the other, the sea was so boisterous that it forced
the capsten in such sorte, that the men which were at it could
not rule the same, and it strooke a Negro of the Generals such a
blowe, that it cast him downe along vpon the decke, and did the
like vnto another mariner and one of the barres strooke our fire-furnace
so violently, that it cast it ouerboord into the sea. Yet
for all these troubles wee weighed our ankers, and set sayle, and
albeit we had great tempests at sea, yet made we no account
thereof in respect of the ioy which we conceiued to see our selues
freed of the perill of being cast on that shore with our ships,
especially seeing it fell out at midnight, at which time no man
could haue escaped, but by a meere myracle from God.</p>

<p>Wee sayled vp and downe the sea all Thursday, and vntill
Friday in the morning being the fourteeneth day of February,
and the waues of the sea continually came raking ouer our
deckes. At length, on Saturday morning at breake of day we
could finde no remedy against the contrary windes, notwithstanding
the Generall was very obstinate to haue vs keepe out at
sea, although it were very tempestuous, least we should be driuen
to put backe againe, but no diligence nor remedie preuailed: for
the windes were so boysterous and so contrary, that they could
not be worse, and the sea went still higher, and swelled more and
more, and that in such sorte, that we greatly feared wee should
all perish. Whereupon the Pilot thought it our best course to
returne to the Isle of Cedars, whither wee had repaired three or
foure times before by reason of the selfe same contrary windes,
for wee tooke this Island for our father and mother, although we
receiued no other benefite thereby saue this onely, namely, to
repaire thither in these necessities, and to furnish our selues with
water, and with some small quantitie of fish.</p>

<p>Being therefore arriued at this Island; and riding vnder the
shelter thereof, the contrary windes did alwayes blow very
strongly, and here we tooke water which we drunke, and wood
for our fewel, and greatly desired, that the windes would bee
more fauourable for proceeding on our iourney. And though we
<!--367.png-->
<span class="pagenum">371</span>
rode under the shelter of the Isle, yet felt wee the great fury of
those windes, and the rage of the sea, and our ships neuer ceased
rolling.</p>

<p>At breake of day the twentieth of February, wee found the
cable of the Admirall cracked, whereupon, to our great griefe,
we were constrained to set sayle, to fall downe lower the space
of a league, and the Trinitie came and rode in our company.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 15.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">They goe on land in the isle of Cedars, and take diuers wilde
beastes, and refresh and solace themselues. They are
strangely tossed with the Northwest winde, and seeking
often to depart they are forced, for the auoiding of many

<p>The two and twentieth of February being the second Sonday
in Lent, the General went on shore with the greatest part of his
people and the friers, neere vnto a valley which they sawe before
them. And hearing masse on land, certaine souldiers and
mariners, with certaine dogges which we had in our company
went into the said valley, and we met with certaine deere,
whereof we tooke a female, which was little, but fat, whose haire
was liker the haire of a wild goat then of a deere, and we found
her not to be a perfect deere, for she had foure dugs like vnto a
cowe full of milke, which made vs much to marueile. And after
we had flayed off her skinne, the flesh seemed more like the flesh
of a goate, then of a deere. We killed likewise a gray conie, in
shape like vnto those of Nueua Espanna, and another as blacke
as heben-wood. In the cottages at the shelter aboue, where we
brake our cable, we found many pine-nuts opened, which (in
mine opinion) the Indians had gathered together to eate the
kernels of them. On Munday the 23 of the said moneth we
rode at anker, taking our pleasure and pastime with fishing.
And the Northwest winde began to blow, which waxed so great
a little before midnight, as it was wonderfull: so that although
we were vnder the shelter of the Island, and greatly defended
from that wind, yet for all that it was so furious, and the sea
became so raging and boisterous, that it greatly shook our ships,
and we were in great feare of breaking our cables, whereof
(to say the trueth) we had very much neede: for hauing
<!--368.png-->
<span class="pagenum">372</span>
spent longer time in this voyage then we looked for,
wee had broken two, and lost two of our best
ankers. This furious winde continued vntill the next being
Tewsday the 24 when as we went on shore with the friers, who sayd
vs masse, recommending our selues to God, beseeching him to
vouchsafe to succour and help vs with some good weather that
we might proceede on our voyage, to the aduancement of his
seruice. And still the winds were so high and outragious, that
the deuill seemed to be loosed in the aire. Whereupon the
Pilots caused all the masts to be let downe, least they should be
shaken with the wind, and tooke off all the shrowds, and likewise
caused the cabbens in the sterne to be taken away, that the
winds might haue more free passage, for the safetie of the ships:
yet for al this they ceased not to be in great trouble. On Tewsday
the second of March, about midnight or somewhat after,
riding vnder the Island in this distresse, there came a gust of
Northwest winde, which made the cable of the Admirall to slip,
and the Trinitie brake her cable, and had bene cast away, if God
of his mercy had not prouided for vs, together with the diligence
which the Pilots vsed, in hoising the sailes of the trinkets and
mizzen, wherewith they put to sea, and rode by another anker
vntill day, when the men of both the ships went with their boats
to seeke the anker vntill noone, which at length they found and
recouered, not without great paines and diligence which they
vsed in dragging for it, for they were till noone in seeking the
same, and had much adoe to recouer it. After this we set vp our
shrowdes, and all things necessary to saile, for to proceede on our
voyage, if it pleased God, and not to stay alwayes in that place,
as lost and forlorne. Thus on the Wednesday two or three houres
after dinner wee set saile, with a scarce winde at Southeast, which
was fauourable for our course and very scant; and our Pilots and
all the rest of vs were in no small feare, that it would not continue
long. We began therefore to set forward, although we seemed
to see before our eies, that at the end of the Island we should
meete with contrary winde at North and Northwest. This day
about euening when our ships had discouered the point of this
Isle of Cedars, wee began to perceiue those contrary windes, and
the sea to go so loftily, that it was terrible to behold. And the
farther we went, the more the winds increased, so that they put
vs to great distresse, sayling alwayes with the sheates of our
mainesaile and trinket warily in our hands, and with great diligence
<!--369.png-->
<span class="pagenum">373</span>
we loosed the ties of all the sailes, to saue them the better,
that the wind might not charge them too vehemently. For all
this the mariners thought it best to returne backe, and that by no
means we should runne farre into the sea, because we were in
extreame danger. Whereupon wee followed their counsel,
turning backe almost to the place from whence we departed,
whereat we were al not a little grieued, because we could not
prosecute our voyage, and began to want many things for the
furniture of our ships. The 8 of March being Munday about
noone the Generall commanded vs to set saile; for a small gale
of winde blew from the West, which was the wind whereof we
had most need, to follow our voyage, whereat wee were all glad
for the great desire which wee had to depart out of that place.
Therefore we began to set saile, and to passe toward the point of
the Island, and to shape our course toward the coast of the firme
land, to view the situation thereof. And as we passed the
Island, and were betwixt it and the maine, the Northwest being
a contrary wind began to blow, which increased so by degrees,
that we were constrained to let fall the bonets of our sailes, to
saue them, striking them very low. And the Trinitie seeing this
bad weather returned forthwith vnto the place from whence we
departed, and the Admiral cast about all night in the sea, vntill
the morning; and the chiefe Pilot considering that by no means
we could proceed farther without danger, if we should continue
at sea any longer, resolued that we should retire our selues againe
to that shelter, where we rode at anker vntill Thursday. And
on Friday about noone we set saile againe with a scarce winde,
and in comming forth vnto the point of the Island, we met againe
with contrary winde at Northwest: whereupon running all night
with the firme land, on Saturday in the morning being S.
Lazarus day and the 13 of March, we came in sight thereof, in
viewing of the which we all reioyced, and we souldiers would
very willingly haue gone on shore. This night fel great store of
raine like the raine in Castilia, and we were all well wet in the
morning, and we tooke great pleasure in beholding the situation
of that firme land, because it was greene, and because we had
discouered a pleasant valley and plaines of good largenes, which
seemed to bee enuironed with a garland of mountains. At length
for feare of misfortunes, seeing the sea so high, we durst not stay
here or approch neere the land, and because we had great
want of cables and ankers, we were again constrained to put to
<!--370.png-->
<span class="pagenum">374</span>
sea; and being in the same, and finding the said contrary
windes, the Pilots iudged that we had none other remedie,
but againe to retire our selues to our wonted shelter. And
thus we returned, but somewhat aboue the old place. On
Sunday we rode here to the great grief of all the company, considering
what troubles we indured, and could not get forward;
so that this was such a corrasiue, as none could be more
intollerable. This day being come to an anker wee had a
mighty gale of wind at Northwest, which was our aduersary and
capital enemie, and when day was shut in, it still grew greater
and greater, so that the ships rouled much. And after midnight,
toward break of day, the Trinitie brake her two cables, which
held the two ankers which she had, and seeing her selfe thus
forlorne, she turned vp and downe in the sea vntill day, and
came and rode neere vs, by one anker which shee had left. This
day all of vs went to seeke these lost ankers, and for all the
diligence which wee vsed, wee could find but one of them. We
rode at anker all day vntill night, when the Trinitie againe brake
a cable, which certaine rocks had cut asunder: whereupon the
General commanded that she should ride no longer at anker, but
that shee should turne vp and downe, as she had done before in
sight of vs, which she did al day long, and at night she came to
an anker ouer against a fresh water somewhat lower, and wee
went and rode hard by her. On Palmesunday we went on shore
with the fathers, which read the passion vnto vs and said masse,
and we went in procession with branches in our hands. And so
being comforted, because we had receiued that holy Sacrament,
we returned to our ships.</p>

<p>Here we continued vntill the Wednesday before Easter being
<!--371.png-->
<span class="pagenum">375</span>
the foure and twentieth of March, on which day wee consulted
together, that because the ships were ill conditioned, and wanted
necessary furniture to proceede any further, it were best for vs to
returne backe to New Spaine, as also because our clothes were
consumed: but the Generall seemed not willing to returne, but
to proceed on his voyage: and in fine it was resolued, that seeing
both the ships could not proceede forward, as well because they
had lost their necessary furnitures, as also that the Santa Agatha
had neede of calking, because she receiued much water, and was
the worst furnished of the twaine, that shee should returne backe
to aduertise the Marques of our successe in this voyage, and
what hindred our proceeding, and in what case wee stoode, and
howe wee were bereft of our necessary furniture. And because
the Trinitie was the swifter ship, and better appointed then the
other, it was concluded, that it should be prouided in the best
maner that might be, and that the General should proceed on his
iourney in her with such companie as he should make choise of,
and that the rest should returne at their good leisure. Wherefore
vpon this determination we went vnder a point of this Island,
because it was a fit place to carene the ship: and in recouering
the same we spent Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday till noone,
and yet for all that wee could not wel double it, vntil Easter
day about noone. Here we ankered very neere the shore
and in a valley we found very excellent fresh water, whereof
we made no smal account, and here stayed all the Easter
holidayes, to set our selues about the furnishing vp of the
Trinity: and after the worke was taken in hand by the
two Masters which were very sufficient calkers (one of
which was Iuan Castiliano chiefe Pilot, and the other
Peruccio de Bermes) they finished the same so well in fiue
dayes, as it was wonderfull; for no man could perceiue
how any droppe of water could enter into any of the
seames. Afterward they mended the other ship from
Saturday till Munday, during which time all those were shriuen
that had not confessed, and receiued the communion, and it was
resolued by charge of the confessors, that all those seale-skins
which they had taken from the Indians should bee restored
againe; and the Generall gaue charge to Francis Preciado to
restore them all, charging him on his conscience so to doe.
Thus they gathered them together, and deliuered them into the

<span class="pagenum">376</span>
hands of the fathers, to bee kept vntill they returned
to the place, where they were to restore them.

shed no small number of teares, and we chose for
our captaine in the Santa Agueda master Iuan Castiliano the
chiefe pilot, as well of the ship, as of vs all, and set saile the
same day being the fift of April, hauing our boat tied at our
sterne, till we came ouer against the cottages, whence
wee had taken the seale-skins.

From the countrey

now distant some three hundreth leagues, which is
the first port where wee determined to touch at. And hauing
sailed a league from the Trinitie the captaine Iuan Castiliano
commanded vs to salute them with three pieces of great Ordinance,
and she answered vs with other three, and afterward we answered
one another with two shot apiece.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The sixt of Aprill.</span>
We sailed on Munday and Tewsday til noone with contrary
wind in sight of the Island, and at noone we had a
fresh gale in the poupe, which brought vs ouer against
the cottages of the Indians where we tooke away those
seal-skins; and there certain souldiers and mariners with the
father frier Antony de Melo leapt on shore with the boat, carying
the skins with them, and flung them into the sayd cottages
out of which they were taken, and so returned to their

there any long time: but God which is the true helper prouided
better for vs then we deserued or imagined; for as
we rode here, after midnight the Wednesday following
before ten of the cloke wee had a fauourable gale of
winde from the Southeast, which put vs into the sea;
whither being driuen, wee had the wind at Northwest
so good and constant, that in sixe dayes it
brought vs to the cape of the point of the port of
Santa Cruz: for which so great blessing of God we gaue vnto
him infinite thankes. And here we began to allow our selues a
greater proportion of victuals then wee had done before, for wee
had eaten very sparingly for feare our victuals would faile vs.

Before we came to this point of the hauen of Santa Cruz by sixe
or seuen leagues we saw on shore between certaine
valleys diuers great smokes. And hauing passed
the point of this port, our captaine thought it good
to lanch foorth into the maine Ocean: yet although we ran a
swift course, aboue 500 whales came athwart of vs in 2 or 3
skulles within one houres space, which were so huge, as it was
wonderfull, and some of them, came so neere vnto the ship, that
they swam vnder the same from one side to another, whereupon
we were in great feare, lest they should doe vs some hurt,
but they could not because the ship had a prosperous and good
winde, and made much way, whereby it could receiue no harme,
although they touched and strooke the same.</p>

The true and perfect description of a voyage performed and done
by Francisco de Gualle a Spanish Captaine and Pilot, for
the Vice-roy of New Spaine, from the hauen of Acapulco
in New Spaine, to the Islands of the Lu&ccedil;ones or Philippinas,
vnto the Hauen of Manilla, and from thence to the
Hauen of Macao in China, and from Macao backe againe
to Acapulco, accomplished in the yeere of our Lord, 1584.</div>

<div class="c3">Chap. 1.</div>

<p>The tenth of March in the yeere of our Lorde 1582 wee set
sayle out of the Hauen of Acapulco, lying in the countrey of New
Spaine, directing our course towards the Islands of the Lu&ccedil;ones,
or Philippinas West Southwest, running in that maner for the
space of twentie fiue leagues, till wee came vnder sixteene
degrees, so that wee might shunne the calmes by sayling close by
the shoare. From thence forward we held our course West for
the space of 30 leagues, and being there, we ran West, and West
and by South, for the space of 1800 leagues, to the Iland called
Isla del Enganno, which is the furthest Iland lying in the South
parts of the Ilands called De los Ladrones, that is, The Ilands of
rouers, or Islas de las Velas, vnder 13. degrees and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>. in latitude
Septentrionall, and 164. degrees in longitude Orientall, vpon the
fixed Meridionall line, which lyeth right with the Iland of
Ter&ccedil;era. From thence we helde our coarse Westward for the
space of 280. leagues, till we came to the point called El capo de
Espirito Santo, that, is, The point of the holy Ghost, lying in the
Iland Tandaya, the first Iland of those that are called Philippinas,
Lu&ccedil;ones, or Manillas, which is a countrey with fewe hilles, with
some mines of brimstone in the middle thereof. From the point
aforesayde, wee sailed West for the space of eighteene leagues to
the point or entrie of the chanell, which runneth in betweene
that Iland and the Iland of Lu&ccedil;on. This point or entrie lieth
scarce vnder 12. degrees. All the coast that stretcheth from the
entrie of the chanel to the point of El capo del Spirito santo, is
not very faire.</p>

<p>Eight leagues from the sayde point lyeth a hauen of indifferent
greatnesse, called Baya de Lobos, that is, The Bay of Woolues,
hauing a small Iland at the mouth thereof: and within the
chanell about halfe a league from the ende of the sayd Iland
lyeth an Iland or cliffe, and when you passe by the point in the
<!--375.png-->
<span class="pagenum">379</span>
middle of the chanell, then you haue fiue and twentie fathom
deepe, with browne sand: there we found so great a streame
running Westward, that it made the water to cast a skum as if it
had beene a sande, whereby it put us in feare, but casting out our
lead, wee found fiue and twentie fathom deepe.</p>

<p>From the aforesayd entrie of the chanell North, and North and
by East about tenne leagues, lyeth the Island of Catanduanes, about a
league distant from the lande of Lu&ccedil;on, on the furthest point
Eastward, and from the same entrie of the chanell towards the
West and Southwest, lyeth the Iland Capuli about sixe leagues
from thence, stretching Westsouthwest, and Eastnortheast, being
fiue leagues long, and foure leagues broad: and as wee past by it,
it lay Northward from vs vnder twelue degrees and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. and somewhat
high lande. Foure leagues from the aforesayd Iland of
Capuli Northwestward lie the three Ilands of the hauen of Bollon
in the Iland of Lu&ccedil;ones, stretching North and South about foure
leagues, distant from the firme lande halfe a league, whereof the
furthest Southward lieth vnder thirteene degrees; In this chanell
it is twentie fathome deepe, with white sand, and a great streame,
running Southeast: we passed through the middle of the chanell.
From this chanell wee helde our coarse Southwest, and Southwest
and by West, for the space of twentie leagues, vntill wee came to
the West ende of the Iland of Tycao, which reacheth East and
West thirteene leagues. This point or hooke lyeth vnder 12.
degrees and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. In the middle betweene this Iland and the Iland
Capuli there lie three Ilands called the Faranias, and we ranne in
the same course on the Northside of all the Ilands, at the depth
of 22. fathom with white sand.</p>

<p>From the aforesayd West point of the Iland Tycao to the point
of Buryas it is East and West to sayle about the length of a league
or a league and a halfe: we put into that chanell, holding our
course South, and South and by West about three leagues, vntill
we were out of the chanell at sixteene fathome deepe, with halfe
white and reddish sande in the chanell, and at the mouth thereof,
whereof the middle lyeth vnder 12. degrees and <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>. and there the
streames runne Northward.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The Isle of Masbate.</span>
The Iland of Buryas stretched Northwest and Southeast, and
is low lande, whereof the Northwest point is about three leagues
from the coast of Lu&ccedil;on, but you cannot passe betweene them
with any shippe, but with small foistes and barkes of the countrey.
This shallow channell lieth vnder twelue degrees: and running
<!--376.png-->
<span class="pagenum">380</span>
thorow the aforesayd chanell betweene the Ilands Tycao and
Buryas, as I sayd before, we sayled Southward about two leagues
from the Iland of Masbate, which stretcheth East
and West 8. leagues long, being in bredth 4. leagues,
and lyeth vnder 12. degrees and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. in the middle
thereof, and is somewhat high land.</p>

<p>From the sayd chanell betweene Tycao and Buryas, wee helde
our course Westnorthwest for thirteene leagues, leauing the Iland
Masbate on the Southside, and the Iland Buryas on the North
side: at the ende of thirteene leagues wee came by an Iland
called Banton, which is in forme like a hat, vnder twelue degrees
and <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>. when we had sayled the aforesayd thirteene leagues and
eight leagues more, on the South side wee left the Iland called
Rebuiam, which stretcheth Northwest, and Northwest and by
North, and Southeast, and Southeast and by South, for the space
of eight leagues, being high and crooked lande, whereof the North
point lyeth vnder twelue degrees and <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>. and there you finde 35
fathom deepe, with white sand.</p>

<p>From the aforesayd Iland of Banton Southward nine leagues,
there beginne and followe three Ilandes, one of them being called
Bantonsilla, which is a small Iland in forme of a sugar loafe: the
second Crymara, being somewhat great in length, reaching East
and West about two leagues: the third Itaa, or the Ile of Goates,
hauing certaine houels. By all these Ilands aforesayd you may
passe with all sortes of shippes, whereof the foremost lyeth Southward
vnder twelue degrees and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. From the Iland of Bantonsilla,
or small Banton, wee helde our course Northwest for the space of
foure leagues, to the chanell betweene Ilands called de Vereies,
and the Iland of Marinduque, the Vereies lying on the South side
vnder twelue degrees and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. (which are two small Ilands like two
Frigats) and the Iland Marinduque on the North side vnder
twelue degrees, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. which is a great Iland, stretching Westnorthwest,
and Eastsoutheast, hauing in length 12. and in bredth
7. leagues. On the North side, with the Iland Lu&ccedil;on it maketh
a long and small chanell, running somewhat crooked, which is
altogether full of shallowes and sandes, whereby no shippes can
passe through it. The furthest point Westward of the same Iland
lyeth vnder thirteene degrees and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. It is high lande, on the
East side hauing the forme of a mine of brimstone or fierie hill,
and on the West side the land runneth downewarde at the point
thereof being round like a loafe of bread: in the chanell betweene
<!--377.png-->
<span class="pagenum">381</span>
it and the Vereies, there are 18. fathom deepe with small black
sand.</p>

<p>From the aforesaid chanell of Vereies and Marinduque, wee
helde our course Westnorthwest twelue leagues to the lande of
Mindora, to the point or hooke called Dumaryn, lying full vnder
thirteene degrees: Fiue leagues forward from the sayde chanell
on the South side wee left an Iland called Isla de maestro del
Campo, that is, The Iland of the Colonell, lying vnder twelue
degrees and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. which is a small and flat Iland: In this course we
had 45 fathom deep white sand.</p>

<p>By this point or end of the Iland Marinduque beginneth
the Iland of Myndoro, which hath in length East and West
fiue and twentie leagues, and in bredth twelue leagues,
whereof the furthest point Southward lyeth vnder thirteene
degrees, and the furthest point Northward vnder thirteene
degrees and <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>. and the furthest point Westward vnder thirteene
degrees. This Iland with the Iland of Lu&ccedil;on maketh a chanell
of fiue leagues broad, and ten or twelue fathom deepe with
muddie ground of diuers colours, with white sande. Fiue leagues
forward from Marinduque lyeth the riuer of the towne of
Anagacu, which is so shallowe, that no shippes may enter into it.
From thence two leagues further lie the Ilands called Bacco,
which are three Ilands lying in a triangle, two of them being distant
from the land about three hundred cubits, and between
them and the land you may passe with small shippes:
And from the lande to the other Iland, are about two hundred
cubites, where it is altogether shallowes and sandes, so that
where the shippes may passe outward about 150. cubites from the
lande, you leaue both the Ilands on the South side, running
betweene the third Iland and the riuer called Rio del Bacco,
somewhat more from the middle of the chanell towardes the
Iland, which is about a league distant from the other; the chanell
is tenne fathom deepe, with mud and shelles vpon the ground:
the riuer of Bacco is so shallowe, that no ships may enter into it.
From this Iland with the same course two leagues forward, you
passe by the point called El Capo de Rescaseo, where we cast out
our lead, and found that a man may passe close by the lande, and
there you shall finde great strong streames: and halfe a league
forward with the same course, lyeth the towne of Mindoro, which
hath a good hauen for shippes of three hundred tunnes. Three
leagues Northward from the same hauen lyeth the Iland called
Cafaa, stretching from East to West, being hilly ground.</p>

<p><!--378.png--><span class="pagenum">382</span></p>

<p>From the sayde towne of Myndora, wee helde our course
Westnorthwest eight leagues, till wee came to the poynt or hooke
of the sandes called Tulen, lying vpon the Iland of Lu&ccedil;on, which
sande or banke reacheth into the Sea halfe a league from the
coast: you must keepe about an hundred cubites from it, where
you finde eight fathom water, muddie and shellie ground: you
runne along by those sandes North, and North and by West for
the space of two leagues, till you come to the riuer called Rio de
Anasebo: all the rest of the coast called De los Limbones to the
month or entrie of the Bay called Manilla, (which are foure
leagues) is sayled with the same course. The Limbones (which
are Ilands so called) are high in forme like a paire of Organs, with
good hauens for small shippes, running along by the Limbones:
and two leagues beyond them on the South side, wee leaue the
Ilands of Fortan, and foure Ilands more, but the three Ilands of
Lubao, which are very low, lie vnder 13. degrees and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>. and the
Limbones lie in the mouth or entrie of the Bay of Manilla vnder
14. degrees and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>From thence we ranne Northwest for the space of sixe leagues
to the hauen of Cabite, keeping along by the land lying on the
West side, where it is shallowe, and is called Los Baixos del Rio
de Cannas, The shallowes of the riuer of Reedes: all along this Bay
in the same course, there is from ten to foure fathom deepe.</p>

<p>Being by the point or hooke of Cabite, then wee kept but an
hundred paces from it, running Southwest, southsouthwest, and
South, vntill we discouered the whole mouth or entrie of the Bay,
where we might anker at foure fathom about two hundred cubites
from the lande, and then the towne of Manilla was two leagues
Northward from vs.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

The Philippine Islands are an archipelago of about 1400 islands, forming
a dependency of Spain, lying between 4 deg. 40 min and 20 deg. N. lat., and
116 deg. 40 min. and 126 deg. 30 min. E. lon., and having the China Sea on
the west, and the Pacific Ocean on the East. They are very imperfectly
known at present, but are estimated to have a total area of 114,000 square
miles, and a population of about 10,000,000. The principal islands of the
many hundreds of large and small forming the group are&mdash;Luzon, Mindanao,
Palawan, Mindoro, Panay, Negros, Zebu, Leyte, and Samar.<br />
<br />
The Philippines were discovered by Fernando Magalhaens in 1521, in the
reign of Philip II, after whom they were named; and in 1564 the Spaniards
made a settlement on one of the islands, and founded Manila in 1571. They
obtained the possession of this important group almost without bloodshed;
and they have preserved it by the extensive diffusion of the Roman Catholic
religion among the Malays, who form the greater part of the population. The
Spaniards have retained the island ever since, except from 1762 to 1764,
during which the English held Manila, and for the release of which the
Spaniards paid a ransom of &pound;1,000,000.</div>

<p>Sayling out of the hauen of Cabite, lying in the Bay of
Manilla, wee helde our course Westwarde for the space of
eighteene leagues, to the point called El Cabo de Samballes:
and when wee were eight leagues in our way, wee left the two
Ilands Maribillas on the South side, and sailed about a league from

ground, which Cape lyeth vnder sixteene degrees and <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>. From

sixtie leagues, vntill we were past the length of the Ilands Lequeos,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
sayling about fiftie leagues from them: the said Chinar tolde me,
that those Ilands called Lequeos are very many, and that they
haue many and very good hauens, and that the people and
inhabitants thereof haue their faces and bodies painted like the
Bysayas of the Ilands of Lu&ccedil;on or Philippinas and are apparelled
like the Bysayas, and that there also are mines of gold: Hee sayd
likewise that they did often come with small shippes and barkes
laden with Bucks and Harts-hides, and with golde in graines or
very small pieces, to traffique with them of the coast of China,
<!--381.png-->
<span class="pagenum">385</span>
which hee assured mee to bee most true, saying that hee had
bene nine times in the small Ilands, bringing of the same wares
with him to China: which I beleeued to bee true, for that afterwarde
I enquired thereof in Macao, and upon the coast of China,
and found that hee sayde true. The furthest or vttermost of
these Ilands stretching Northwarde and Eastwarde, lie vnder nine
and twentie degrees.</p>

The Lu-Tchu (<i>Chinese</i>) or Liu-Khiu (<i>Japanese</i>) Islands are a chain of
52 Islands belonging to Japan, and stretching S.W. to Formosa.</div>

<p>Being past these Ilands, then you come to the Ilands of Iapon,
whereof the first lying West and South, is the Iland of Firando,
where the Portugals vse to traffique: they are in length altogether
an hundred and thirtie leagues, and the furthest Eastward lieth
under two and thirtie degrees: we ranne still East, and East and
by North, vntill we were past the sayd hundred and thirtie
leagues.</p>

<p>All this information I had of the aforesaid Chinar, as also that
there I should see some mines of brimstone or fierie hilles, being
seuentie leagues beyond them,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and thirtie leagues further I
should finde four Ilands lying together, which I likewise found,
as hee had tolde mee:
<span class="sidenote">Other Ilands Eastward of Iapon.</span>
And that being in Iapon, he sayd hee had
there seene certaine men of a very small stature, with great rolle
of linnen cloth about there heads, that brought golde in small
pieces, and some white Cangas of cotton, (which are
pieces of cotton-linnen so called by the Chinars) as
also salte-fish like the Spanish Atun, or Tunney,
which hee sayde came out of other Ilands Eastward from Iapon:
and by the tokens and markes which hee shewed mee, I gessed
whereabout those Ilands should bee, and found them not farre
from whence he sayd they lay. Hee sayd likewise that all the
Ilands of Iapon haue good hauens and chanels, being a Countrey
full of Rice, Corne, Fish, and flesh, and that they are indifferent
and reasonable people to traffique with, and that there they
haue much siluer.</p>

This probably refers to Fusyiama, which can be seen from Tokio, 80 miles
away. Its last eruption took place in 1707.</div>

<p>Running thus East, and East and by North about three hundred
leagues from Iapon, wee found a very hollowe water, with the
streame running out of the North and Northwest, with a full and
very broad Sea, without any hinderance or trouble in the way
that wee past: and what winde soeuer blewe, the Sea continued
<!--382.png-->
<span class="pagenum">386</span>
all in one sort, with the same hollow water and streame,
vntill wee had passed seuen hundred leagues.
<span class="sidenote">Iapon 900. leagues distant from the coast of

About
two hundred leagues from the coast and land of newe
Spaine wee beganne to lose the sayd hollow Sea, and
streame: whereby I most assuredly thinke and beleeue,
that there you shall finde a chanell or straight passage,
betweene the firme lande of newe Spaine, and the Countreys
of Asia and Tartaria. Likewise all this way from the aforesayde
seuen hundred leagues, we found a great number of Whale-fishes
and other fishes called by the Spaniards Atuns or Tunnies,
whereof many are found on the coast of Gibraltar in Spaine, as
also Albacoras and Bonitos, which are all fishes, which commonly
keepe in chanels, straights, and running waters, there to disperse
their seede when they breede: which maketh mee more assuredly
beleeue, that thereabouts is a chanel or straight to passe through.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Read Francis Vlloa <a href="#Chap_16">chap.

Being by the same course vpon the coast of newe Spaine, vnder
seuen and thirtie degrees and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>. wee passed by a very high and
faire lande with many trees, wholly without snowe, and foure
leagues from the lande, you finde thereabouts many drifts of
rootes, leaues of trees, reeds, and other leaues like
figge leaues, the like whereof wee found in great
abundance in the countrey of Iapon, which they eate:
and some of those that wee found, I caused to bee sodden with
flesh, and being sodden, they eate like Coleworts: there likewise
wee found great store of Seales: whereby it is to bee presumed
and certainely to bee beleeued, that there are many riuers, bayes,
and hauens along by those coastes to the hauen of Acapulco.</p>

<p>From thence wee ranne Southeast, Southeast and by South, and
Southeast and by East, as wee found the winde, to the point called
El Cabo de Sant Lucas, which is the beginning of the lande of
California, on the Northwest side, lying vnder two and twentie
degrees, being fiue hundred leagues distant from Cape Mendo&ccedil;ino.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Hauens lately found out.</span>
In this way of the aforesayde fiue hundred leagues
along by the coast, are many Ilands: and although
they bee but small, yet without doubt there are in
them some good hauens, as also in the firme land, where you haue
these hauens following, now lately found out, as that of the Ile of
Sant Augustine, lying vnder thirtie degrees and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. and the Iland
called Isla de Cedros, scarce vnder eight and twenty deg. and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.
and the Iland lying beneath Saint Martyn, vnder three and
<!--383.png-->
<span class="pagenum">387</span>
twentie degrees and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>. All this coast and countrey, as I thinke,
is inhabited, and sheweth to be a very good countrey: for there
by night wee sawe fire, and by day smoke, which is a most sure
token that they are inhabited.</p>

<p>From the poynt or hooke of Saint Lucas, to the Southeast side
of California, wee helde our course Eastsoutheast, for the space of
80. leagues, to the point called El cabo de las corrientes, that is,
the Cape of the streames lying vnder 19. degrees and <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>. And
running this course, Northward about a league from vs wee sawe
three Ilands called Las tres Marias, (that is to say, The three
Maries) running the same course. About foure leagues from the
other Ilands, there are other Ilands, reaching about two or three
leagues: All this way from the mouth or gulfe of California
aforesayd, for the space of the sayd fourescore leagues, there are
great streames that run Westward.</p>

<p>From the point or Cape de las Corrientes, we ranne Southeast,
and sometimes Southeast and by East, for the space of an hundred
and thirtie leagues to the hauen of Acapulco. In this way of an
hundred and thirtie leagues, being twentie leagues on the way, we
had the hauen of Natiuidad, that is, of the birth of the Virgin
Mary: and other eight leagues further, the hauen of Saint Iago,
or Saint Iames; and sixe leagues further, the sea Strand called La
Playa de Colima, that is, the Strand of Colima. All this coast
from California to the hauen of Acapulco is inhabited by people
that haue peace and traffique with the Spaniards, and are of condition
and qualities like the people of the other places of new
Spaine.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 1.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Fernando Alarchon after he had suffered a storme, arriued with
his Fleete at the hauen of Saint Iago, and from thence at
the hauen of Aguaiaual: he was in great perill in seeking
to discouer a Bay, and getting out of the same he discouered
a riuer on the coast with a great current, entring
into the same, and coasting along he descried a great
many of Indians with their weapons: with signes hee
hath traffique with them, and fearing some great danger
returneth to his ships.</div>

<p>On Sunday the ninth of May in the yeere 1540. I set saile with
two ships, the one called Saint Peter being Admirall, and the
other Saint Catherine, and wee set forward meaning to goe to
the hauen of Saint Iago of good hope: but before wee arriued
there wee had a terrible storme, wherewith they which were in
the ship called Saint Catherine, being more afraid then was
neede, cast ouer boord nine pieces of Ordinance, two ankers and
one cable, and many other things as needfull for the enterprise
wherein we went, as the ship it selfe. Assoone as we were
arriued at the hauen of Saint Iago I repaired my losse which I
had receiued, prouided my selfe of things necessary, and tooke
aboord my people which looked for my comming, and directed
my course toward the hauen of Aguaiauall. And being there
arriued I vnderstood that the Generall Francis Vazquez de
Coronado was departed with all his people: whereupon taking
the ship called Saint Gabriel which carried victuals for the armie
I led her with mee to put in execution your Lordships order.
Afterward I followed my course along the coast without departing
from the same, to see if I could find any token, or any Indian
which could giue me knowledge of him: and in sailing so neere
the shore I discouered other very good hauens, for the ships
whereof Captaine Francis de Vllua was General for the Marquesse
de Valle neither sawe nor found them.
<span class="sidenote">These shoalds are the bottome of mar Bermejo, or
the Bay of California.</span>
And when we
<!--385.png-->
<span class="pagenum">389</span>
were come to the flats and shoalds from whence
the foresaid fleete returned, it seemed as well to me
as to the rest, that we had the firme land before vs,
and that those shoalds were so perilous and fearefull,
that it was a thing to be considered whither with our
skiffes we could enter in among them: and the
Pilotes and the rest of the company would haue had vs done as
Captaine Vllua did, and haue returned backe againe. But
because your Lordship commanded mee, that I should bring you
the secret of that gulfe, I resolued, that although I had knowen I
should haue lost the shippes, I would not haue ceased for any
thing to haue seene the head thereof: and therefore I commanded
Nicolas Zamorano Pilote maior, and Dominico del
Castello that eche of them should take a boate, and their lead
in their hands, and runne in among those shoalds, to see if
they could find out the chanell whereby the shippes might enter
in: to whom it seemed that the ships might saile vp higher
(although with great trauell and danger) and in this sort I and
he began to follow our way which they had taken, and within a
short while after wee found our selues fast on the sands with all
our three ships, in such sort that one could not helpe another,
neither could the boates succour vs, because the current was so
great that it was impossible for one of vs to come vnto another:
whereupon we were in such great ieopardie that the decke
of the Admirall was oftentimes vnder water, and if a great surge
of the sea had not come and driuen our ship right vp, and gaue
her leaue as it were to breath a while, we had there bin drowned:
and likewise the other two shippes found themselves in very
great hazard, yet because they were lesser and drewe lesse
water, their danger was not so great as ours: Nowe it pleased God
vpon the returne of the flood that the shippes came on flote, and
so wee went forward. And although the company would haue
returned backe, yet for all this I determined to goe forwarde,
and to pursue our attempted voyage: and we passed
forward with much adoe, turning our stemmes now
this way, now that way, to seeke to find the chanel.
<span class="sidenote">The bottome of the Bay of California.</span>
And it pleased God that after this sort we came to
the very bottoms of the Bay: where we found a very mightie
riuer, which ranne with so great fury of a streame, that we could
hardly saile against it.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In this sort I determined as wel as I
<!--386.png-->
<span class="pagenum">390</span>
could to go vp this riuer, and with two boates, leauing the
third with the ships, and twenty men, my selfe being in one of
them with Roderigo Maldonado treasurer of this fleet, and
Gaspar de Castilleia comptroller, and with certaine small pieces
of artillerie I began to saile vp the river, and charged all my
company, that none of them should stirre nor vse any signe, but
he whom I appointed, although wee found Indians.
<span class="sidenote">They goe vp the riuer of Buena guia the 26. of
August.</span>
The same day, which was Thursday the sixe and
twentieth of August, following our voyage with drawing
the boats with halsers we went about some 6
leagues; and the next day which was Friday by the
breake of day thus following our way vpward, I saw certaine
Indians which went toward certaine cottages neere vnto the
water, who assoone as they saw vs, ten or twelue of them rose vp
furiously, and crying with a loud voyce, other of their companions
came running together to the number of 50 which with all haste
carried out of their cottages such things as they had, and layd
them vnder certaine shrubs and many of them came running
toward that part whether wee approched, making great signes
vnto vs that we should goe backe againe, vsing great
threatnings against vs, one while running on this side and an
other while on that side. I seeing them in such a rage, caused
our boates to lanch from the shore into the middes of the riuer,
that the Indians might be out of feare, and I rode at anker, and
set my people in as good order as I could, charging them that no
man should speake, nor make any signe nor motion, nor stirre
out of his place, nor should not be offended for anything that
the Indians did, nor should shewe no token of warre: and by
this meanes the Indians came euery foote neere the riuers side
to see vs: and I gate by little and little toward them where the
riuer seemed to be deepest. In this meane space there were
aboue two hundred and fiftie Indians assembled together with
bowes and arrowes, and with certaine banners in warrelike sort
in such maner as those of New Spayne doe vse: and perceiuing
that I drewe toward the shore, they came with great
cryes toward vs with bowes and arrowes put into them, and with
their banners displayed. And I went vnto the stemme of my
boate with the interpreter which I carried with me, whom I
commanded to speake vnto them, and when he spake, they
neither vnderstood him, nor he them, although because they
sawe him to be after their fashion, they stayed themselues:
<!--387.png-->
<span class="pagenum">391</span>
and seeing this I drewe neerer the shore, and they with
great cryes came to keepe mee from the shore of the riuer,
making signes that I should not come any further, putting
stakes in my way betweene the water and the land: and the more
I lingered, the more people still flocked together. Which when
I had considered I beganne to make them signes of peace, and
taking my sword and target, I cast them downe in the boate and
set my feete vpon them, giving them to vnderstand with this and
other tokens that I desired not to haue warre with them, and
that they should doe the like:
<span class="sidenote">A very good course taken to appease unknowen
Sauages.</span>
Also I tooke a
banner and cast it downe; and I caused my company
that were with mee to sit downe likewise, and taking
the wares of exchange which I carried with mee, I
called them to giue them some of them: yet for all
this none of them stirred to take any of them, but rather flocked
together, and beganne to make a great murmuring among
themselues: and suddenly one came out from among them with
a staffe wherein certayne shelles were set, and entred into the
water to giue them vnto mee, and I tooke them, and made signes
vnto him that hee should come neere me, which when he had
done, I embraced him, and gaue him in recompence certaine
beades and other things, and he returning with them vnto his
fellowes, began to looke vpon them, and to parley together, and
within a while after many of them came toward me, to whom
I made signes to lay downe their banners, and to leaue
their weapons: which they did incontinently, then I made signes
that they should lay them altogether, and should goe aside from
them, which likewise they did: and they caused those Indians
which newly came thither to leaue them, and to lay them together
with the rest. After this I called them vnto me, and to all them
which came I gaue some smal trifle, vsing them gently, and by
this time they were so many that came thronging about mee,
that I thought I could not stay any longer in safety among them,
and I made signes vnto them that they should withdraw themselues,
and that they should stand al vpon the side of an hill
which was there betweene a plaine and the riuer, and that they
should not presse to me aboue ten at a time. And immediately
the most ancient among them called unto them with a loud
voyce, willing them to do so: and some ten or twelue of them
came where I was: whereupon seeing my selfe in some securitie,
I determined to goe on land the more to put them out of feare:
<!--388.png-->
<span class="pagenum">392</span>
and for my more securitie, I made signes vnto them, to sit downe
on the ground which they did: but when they saw that ten or
twelue of my companions came a shore after me, they began
to be angry, and I made signes vnto them that we would
be friends, and that they should not feare, and herewithal they
were pacified, and sate down as they did before, and I went
vnto them, and imbraced them, giuing them certain trifles,
commanding mine interpreter to speake vnto them, for I
greatly desired to vnderstand their maner of speech, and the
cry which they made at mee. And that I might knowe what
maner of foode they had, I made a signe vnto them, that wee
would gladly eate, and they brought mee certaine cakes
of Maiz, and a loafe of Mizquiqui, and they made signes vnto
mee that they desired to see an harquebuse shot off,
which I caused to be discharged, and they were all wonderfully
afraid, except two or three olde men among them which were not
mooued at all, but rather cried out vpon the rest, because they
were afrayd: and through the speach of one of these olde men,
they began to rise vp from the ground, and to lay hold on their
weapons: whom when I sought to appease, I would haue giuen
him a silken girdle of diuers colours, and hee in a great rage bitte
his nether lippe cruelly, and gaue mee a thumpe with his elbowe
on the brest, and turned in a great furie to speake vnto his
company. After that I saw them aduance their banners, I
determined to returne my selfe gently to my boates, and with a
small gale of wind I set sayle, whereby wee might breake the
current which was very great, although my company were not
well pleased to goe any farther. In the meane space the Indians
came following vs along the shore of the riuer, making signes
that I should come on land, and that they would giue mee food
to eate, some of them sucking their fingers, and others entred
into the water with certaine cakes of Maiz, to giue me them in
my boate.</p>

<span class="sidenote">Good forecast.</span>
In this sort we went vp two leagues, and I arriued neere a
<!--389.png-->
<span class="pagenum">393</span>
cliffe of an hill, whereupon was an arbour made newly, where
they made signes vnto me, crying that I should go thither,
shewing me the same with their handes, and telling mee that
there was meate to eate. But I would not goe thither,
seeing the place was apt for some ambush, but
followed on my voyage, within a while after issued out from
thence aboue a thousand armed men with their bowes and
arrowes, and after that many women and children shewed
themselues, toward whom I would not goe, but because the
Sunne was almost set, I rode in the middest of the riuer. These
Indians came decked after sundry fashions, some came with a
painting that couered their face all ouer, some had their faces
halfe couered, but all besmouched with cole, and euery one as it
liked him best. Others carried visards before them of the same
colour which had the shape of faces. They weare on their heads
a piece of a Deeres skinne two spannes broad set after the maner
of a helmet, and vpon it certaine small sticks with some sortes of
fethers. Their weapons were bowes and arrowes of hard wood,
and two or three sorts of maces of wood hardened in the fire.
This is a mightie people, well feitured, and without any grossenesse.
They haue holes bored in their nostrels whereat
certaine pendents hang: and others weare shelles, and their eares
are full of holes, whereon they hang bones and shelles. All of
them both great and small weare a girdle about their waste made
of diuerse colours, and in the middle is fastened a round bunch
of feathers, which hangeth downe behind like a tayle. Likewise
on the brawne of their armes they weare a streit string, which
they wind so often about that it becommeth as broad as
ones hand. They weare certaine pieces of Deeres bones
fastened to their armes, wherewith they strike off the sweate,
and at the other certaine small pipes of canes.
<span class="sidenote">Pipes and bagges of tobacco.</span>
They carry also
certaine little long bagges about an
hand broade tyed to their left arme, which serue
them also instead of brasers for their bowes, full of the
powder of a certaine herbe, whereof they make a certaine beuerage.
They haue their bodies traced with coles, their haire cut before,
and behind it hangs downe to their wast. The women goe
naked, and weare a great wreath of fethers behind them, and
before painted and glued together, and their haire like the men.
There were among these Indians three or foure men in
womens apparell. Nowe the next day being Saturday very
<!--390.png-->
<span class="pagenum">394</span>
early I went forward on my way vp the riuer, setting on shore
two men for eache boate to drawe them with the rope, and
about breaking foorth of the Sunne, wee heard a mightie
crie of Indians on both sides of the riuer with their weapons,
but without any banner. I thought good to attend their
comming, aswell to see what they woulde haue, as also to try
whither our interpreter could vnderstand them. When they
came ouer against vs they leapt into the riuer on both sides
with their bowes and arrowes, and when they spake, our interpreter
vnderstoode them not: whereupon I beganne to make
a signe vnto them that they should lay away their weapons,
as the other had done. Some did as I willed them, and some
did not, and those which did, I willed to come neere me and
gaue them some things which we had to trucke withall, which
when the others perceiued, that they might likewise haue their
part, they layd away their weapons likewise. I iudging my selfe
to be in securitie leaped on shore with them, and stoode in the
middest of them, who vnderstanding that I came not to fight with
them, began to giue some of those shels and beades, and some
brought me certaine skinnes well dressed, and others Maiz and a
roll of the same naughtily grinded, so that none of them came
vnto me that brought mee not something, and before they gaue
it me going a little way from mee they began to cry out amayne,
and made a signe with their bodies and armes, and afterward they
approached to giue me that which they brought. And now that
the Sunne beganne to set I put off from the shore, and rode, in
the middest of the riuer. The next morning before break of day
on both sides of the riuer wee heard greater cries and of more
Indians, which leaped into the riuer to swimme, and they came
to bring mee certaine gourdes full of Maiz, and of those wrethes
which I spake of before.
<span class="sidenote">A notable policie.</span>
I shewed vnto them Wheate and
Beanes, and other seedes, to see whether they had any of those
kindes: but they shewed me that they had no knowledge of
them, and wondred at all of them, and by signes I came to
vnderstand that the thing which they most esteemed and
reuerenced was the Sunne: and I signified vnto them
that I came from the Sunne. Whereat they maruelled,
and then they began to beholde me from the
toppe to the toe, and shewed me more favour then they did
before; and when I asked them for food, they brought me such
aboundance that I was inforced twise to call for the boates to put
<!--391.png-->
<span class="pagenum">395</span>
it into them, and from that time forward of all the things which
they brought me they flang vp into the ayre one part vnto the
Sunne, and afterward turned towards me to giue mee the other
part: and so I was alwayes better serued and esteemed of them
as well in drawing of the boats vp the riuer, as also in giuing me
food to eat: and they shewed me so great loue, that when I
stayed they would have carried vs in their armes vnto their
houses: and in no kind of thing they would breake my commandment:
and for my suretie, I willed them not to carry any
weapons in my sight: and they were so careful to doe so, that if
any man came newly thither with them, suddenly they
would goe and meete him to cause him to lay them downe
farre from mee: and I shewed them that I tooke great pleasure
in their so doing:
<span class="sidenote">Swarmes of people.</span>
and to some of the chiefe of them
I gaue certaine little napkins and other trifles; for if
I should haue giuen somewhat to euery one of them
in particular, all the small wares in New Spayne would not haue
sufficed. Sometimes it fell out (such was the great loue and
good wil which they shewed me) that if any Indians came thither
by chance with their weapons, and if any one being warned to
leaue them behind him, if by negligence, or because he vnderstood
them not at the first warning, he had not layd them away,
they would runne vnto him, and take them from him by force,
and would breake them in pieces in my presence. Afterward
they tooke the rope so louingly, and with striuing one with
another for it, that we had no need to pray them to doe it.
Wherefore if we had not had this helpe, the current of the riuer
being exceeding great, and our men that drew the rope being not
well acquainted with that occupation, it would haue beene impossible
for vs to haue gotten vp the riuer so against the streame.
When I perceiued that they vnderstood mee in all things, and
that I likewise vnderstoode them, I thought good to try by some
way or other to make a good entrance to find some good issue
to obtaine my desire: And I caused certaine crosses to be made
of certaine small sticks and paper, and among others when I gaue
any thing I gaue them these as things of most price and kissed
them, making signes vnto them that they should honour them
and make great account of them, and that they should weare
them at their necks: giuing them to vnderstand that this signe
was from heauen, and they tooke them and kissed them, and
lifted them vp aloft, and seemed greatly to reioyce thereat when
<!--392.png-->
<span class="pagenum">396</span>
they did so, and sometime I tooke them into my boate, shewing
them great good will, and sometime I gaue them of those trifles
which I caried with me. And at length the matter grew to such
issue, that I had not paper and stickes ynough to make crosses.
In this matter that day I was very well accompanied, vntill that
when night approched I sought to lanch out into the riuer, and
went to ride in the middest of the streame, and they came to
aske leaue of me to depart, saying that they would returne the
next day with victuals to visite me, and so by litle and little they
departed, so that there stayed not aboue fiftie which made fires
ouer against vs, and stayed there al night calling vs, and before
the day was perfectly broken, they leapt into the water and
swamme vnto vs asking for the rope, and we gaue it them with a
good will, thanking God for the good prouision which he gaue vs
to go vp the riuer: for the Indians were so many, that if they
had gone about to let our passage, although we had bene many
more then wee were, they might haue done it.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 3.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">One of the Indians vnderstanding the language of the interpreter,
asketh many questions of the originall of the Spaniards,
he telleth him that their Captaine is the child of the
Sunne, and that he was sent of the Sunne vnto them, and
they would haue receiued him for their king. They take
this Indian into their boat, and of him they haue many
informations of that countrey.</div>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A wise deuise.</span>
In this manner we sailed vntill Tuesday at night, going as we
were wont, causing mine interpreter to speak vnto the people to
see if peraduenture any of them could vnderstand him, I perceiued
that one answered him, whereupon I caused the boates to
be stayed, and called him, which hee vnderstoode, charging mine
interpreter that hee should not speake nor answere
him any thing else, but onely that which I said vnto
him: and I saw as I stood still that that Indian
began to speake to the people with great furie: whereupon all of
them beganne to drawe together, and mine interpreter vnderstood,
that he which came to the boate sayd vnto them, that he
desired to knowe what nation we were, and whence wee came,
and whither we came out of the water, or out of the earth, or
<!--393.png-->
<span class="pagenum">397</span>
from heauen: And at this speech an infinite number of people
came together, which maruelled to see mee speake: and this
Indian turned on this side and on that side to speake vnto them
in another language which mine interpreter vnderstood not.
Whereas he asked me what we were, I answered that we were
Christians, and that we came from farre to see them: and
answering to the question, who had sent me, I said, I was
sent by the Sunne, pointing vnto him by signes as at the
first, because they should not take mee in a lye. He beganne
againe to ask mee, how the Sunne had sent me, seeing he went
aloft in the skie and never stoode still, and seeing these many
yeeres neither he nor their olde men had euer seene such as we
were, of whome they euer had any kind of knowledge, and that
Sunne till that houre had neuer sent any other. I answered him
that it was true that the Sunne made his course aloft in the skie,
and did neuer stand still, yet neuertheless that they might well
perceiue that at his going downe and rising in the morning hee
came neere vnto the earth, where his dwelling was, and that they
euer sawe him come out of one place, and that hee had made
mee in that land and countrey from whence hee came, like as
hee had made many others which hee had sent into other
parties, and that nowe hee had sent me to visitie and view the
same riuer, and the people that dwelt neere the same, that I
should speake vnto them, and should ioyne with them in friendshippe,
and should giue them things which they had not, and
that I should charge them that they should not make warre one
against another. Whereunto he answered, that I should tell him
the cause why the Sunne had not sent mee no sooner to pacifie
the warres which had continued a long time among them,
wherein many had beene slaine. I tolde him the cause hereof
was, because at that time I was but a child. Then he asked the
interpreter whether wee tooke him with vs perforce hauing taken
him in the war, or whether he came with vs of his own accord.
He answered him that he was with vs of his owne accord, and
was very wel appaid of our company. He returned to enquire,
why we brought none saue him onely that vnderstood vs, and
wherefore we vnderstood not all other men, seeing we were the
children of the Sunne: he answered, that the Sunne also had
begotten him, and giuen him a language to vnderstand him, and
me, and others: that the Sunne knew well that they dwelt there,
but that because he had many other businesses, and
<!--394.png-->
<span class="pagenum">398</span>
because I was but yong hee sent me no sooner. And
he turning vnto me sayd suddenly: Comest thou therefore
hither to bee our Lord, and that wee should serue thee? I
supposing that I should not please him if I should haue said yea,
answered him, not to be their Lord, but rather to be their
brother, and to giue them such things as I had. He asked me,
whether the Sunne had begotten me as he had begotten others,
and whether I was his kinsman or his sonne: I answered him
that I was his sonne. He proceeded to aske me whether the
rest that were with me were also the children of the Sunne, I
answered him no, but that they were borne all with me in one
countrey, where I was brought vp. Then he cryed out with a
loud voyce and sayd, seeing thou doest vs so much good, and
wilt not haue vs to make warre, and art the child of the Sunne,
wee will all receiue thee for our Lord, and alwayes serue thee,
therefore wee pray thee that thou wilt not depart hence nor leaue
vs: and suddenly hee turned to the people, and beganne to tell
them, that I was the childe of the Sunne, and that therefore they
should all chuse me for their Lord. Those Indians hearing this,
were astonied beyond measure, and came neerer still more and
more to behold me. That Indian also asked mee other questions,
which to auoyd tediousnesse I doe not recite: and in this wise
we passed the day, and seeing the night approch, I began by
all meanes I could deuise to get this fellow into our boat with vs:
and he refusing to goe with vs, the interpreter told him that wee
would put him on the other side of the riuer, and vpon this condition
he entred into our boate, and there I made very much of
him, and gaue him the best entertaynement I could, putting him
alwayes in securitie, and when I iudged him to be out of all
suspition, I thought it good to aske him somewhat of that
countrey. And among the first things that I asked him this
was one, whether hee had euer seene any men like vs, or had
heard any report of them.
<span class="sidenote">Newes of bearded and white men.</span>
Hee answered mee no, sauing that
hee had sometime hearde of olde men, that very farre
from that Countrey there were other white men, and
with beardes like vs, and that hee knewe nothing else.
I asked him also whether hee knewe a place called Ceuola, and a
Riuer called Totonteac, and hee answered mee no. Whereupon
perceiuing that hee coulde not giue mee any knowledge of Francis
Vazquez nor of his company, I determined to aske him other
things of that countrey, and of their maner of life: and beganne
<!--395.png-->
<span class="pagenum">399</span>
to enquire of him, whether they helde that there was one God,
creator of heauen and earth, or that they worshipped any other
Idol.
<span class="sidenote">The Sunne worshipped as God.</span>
And hee answered mee no: but that they esteemed and
reuerenced the Sunne aboue all things, because it warmed
them and made their croppes to growe: and that of
all things which they did eate, they cast a little vp
into the ayre vnto him. I asked him next whether
they had any Lorde, and hee sayde no: but that they knewe well,
that there was a great Lorde, but they knewe not well which way
hee dwelt. And I tolde him that hee was in heauen, and that
hee was called Iesus Christ, and I went no farther in diuinitie
with him. I asked him whether they had any warre, and for
what occasion. Hee answered that they had warre and that
very great, and vpon exceeding small occasions: for when they
had no cause to make warre, they assembled together, and some
of them sayd, let vs goe to make warre in such a place, and then
all of them set forward with their weapons. I asked them who
commanded the armie: he answered the eldest and most valiant,
and that when they sayd they should proceede no farther, that
suddenly they retired from the warre. I prayed him to tell me
what they did with those men which they killed in battell: he
answered me that they tooke out the hearts of some of them,
and eat them, and others they burned; and he added, that if it
had not bene for my comming, they should haue bin now at
warre: and because I commanded them that they should not
war, and that they should cease from armes, therefore as long as
I should not command them to take armes, they would not
begin to wage warre against others, and they said among themselues,
that seeing I was come vnto them, they had giuen ouer
their intention of making warre, and that they had a good mind
to liue in peace.
<span class="sidenote">Certaine warlike people behind a mountaine.</span>
He complained of certaine people
which dwelt behind in a mountaine which made
great war vpon them, and slew many of them:
I answered him, that from henceforward they
should not need to feare any more, because I
had commanded them to be quiet, and if they would not obey
my commandement I would chasten them and kill them.
He enquired of me how I could kill them seeing we were so few,
and they so many in number. And because it was now late and
that I saw by this time he was weary to stay any longer with me,
I let him goe out of my boat, and therewith I dismissed him
very well content.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 4.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Of Naguachato and other chiefe men of those Indians they
receiue great store of victuals, they cause them to set vp a
crosse in their countreys, and hee teacheth them to worship
it. They haue newes of many people, of their diuers
languages, and customes in matrimony, how they punish
adultery, of their opinions concerning the dead, and of
the sicknesses which they are subiect vnto.</div>

<p>The next day betimes in the morning came the chiefe man
among them called Naguachato, and wished me to come on land
because he had great store of victuals to giue me. And because
I saw my selfe in securitie I did so without doubting; and
incontinently an olde man came with rols of that Maiz, and
certaine litle gourds, and calling me with a loud voyce and
vsing many gestures with his body and armes, came neere vnto
me, and causing me to turne me vnto that people, and hee himselfe
also turning vnto them sayd vnto them, Sagueyca, and all
the people answered with a great voyce, Hu, and hee offred to
the Sunne a little of euery thing that he had there, and likewise
a little more vnto me (although afterward he gaue me all the
rest) and did the like to all that were with me: and calling out
mine interpreter, by meanes of him I gaue them thanks, telling
them that because my boats were litle I had not brought many
things to giue them in exchange, but that I would come againe
another time and bring them, and that if they would go with me
in my boates vnto my ships which I had beneath at the riuers
mouth, I would giue them many things. They answered that
they would do so, being very glad in countenance. Here by the
helpe of mine interpreter I sought to instruct them what the
sign of the crosse meant, and willed them to bring me a piece of
timber, wherof I caused a great crosse to be made, and commanded
al those that were with mee that when it was made
they should worship it, and beseech the Lord to grant his
grace that so great a people might come to the knowledge of
his holy Catholike faith: and this done I told them by mine
interpreter that I left them that signe, in token that I tooke
them for my brethren, and that they should keepe it for me
carefully vntill I returned, and that euery morning at the
Sunne rising they should kneele before it. And they tooke it
<!--397.png-->
<span class="pagenum">401</span>
incontinently, and without suffering it to touch the ground,
they carried it to set it vp in the middest of their houses,
where all of them might beholde it; and I willed them
alwayes to worshippe it because it would preserue them
from euill. They asked me how deep they should set in the
ground, and I shewed them.
<span class="sidenote">These people are greatly inclined to learne the
Christian faith.</span>
Great store of people
followed the same, and they that stayed behinde
inquired of mee, how they should ioyne their handes,
and how they should kneele to worship the same;
and they seemed to haue great desire to learne it.
<span class="sidenote">The Riuer in diuers places full of shelfes.</span>
This done, I tooke that chiefe man of the Countrey,
and going to our boates with him, I followed my iourney vp the
Riuer, and all the company on both sides of the shoare accompanied
me with great good will, and serued me in
drawing of our boates, and in halling vs off the sands
whereupon we often fel: for in many places we
found the riuer so shoald, that we had no water for our boats.
As wee thus went on our way, some of the Indians which I had
left behind me, came after vs to pray mee that I would throughly
instruct them, how they should ioyne their hands in the worshipping
of the crosse: others shewed me whether they were well set
in such and such sort, so that they would not let me be quiet.
Neere vnto the other side of the riuer was greater store of people,
which called vnto me very often, that I would receiue the victuals
which they had brought me. And because I perceiued that one
enuied the other, because I would not leaue them discontented,
I did so. And here came before me another old man like vnto
the former with the like ceremonyes and offrings: and I sought
to learne something of him as I had done of the other. This
man said likewise to the rest of the people, This is our lord.
Now you see how long ago our ancesters told vs, that there
were bearded and white people in the world, and we laughed
them to scorne. I which am old and the rest which are here,
haue neuer seene any such people as these. And if you wil not
beleeue me, behold these people which be in this riuer: let vs
giue them therefore meate, seeing they giue vs of their victuals:
let vs willingly serue this lord, which wisheth vs so well, and
forbiddeth vs to make warre, and imbraceth all of vs: and they
haue mouth, handes and eyes as we haue, and speake as we doe.
I gaue these likewise another crosse as I had done to the others
beneath, and said vnto them the selfe same words: which they
<!--398.png-->
<span class="pagenum">402</span>
listened vnto with a better will, and vsed greater diligence to
learne that which I said.
<span class="sidenote">Another nation.</span>
Afterward as I passed farther vp the
riuer, I found another people, whom mine interpreter
vnderstood not a whit: wherefore I shewed them by
signes the selfe same ceremonies of worshipping
the crosse, which I had taught the rest. And that principal old
man which I tooke with me, told me that farthur vp the riuer I
should find people which would vnderstand mine interpreter:
and being now late, some of those men called me to giue me
victuals, and did in all poynts as the others had done, dauncing
and playing to shew me pleasure.
<span class="sidenote">People of 23. languages dwelling along this
riuer.</span>
I desired to know what
people liued on the banks of this riuer: and I vnderstood by this
man that it was inhabited by 23 languages, and these
were bordering vpon the riuer, besides others not
farre off, and that there were besides these 23. languages,
other people also which hee knewe not,
aboue the riuer. I asked him whether euery people
were liuing in one towne together: and he answered me, No:
but that they had many houses standing scattered in the fieldes,
and that euery people had their Countrey seuerall and distinguished,
and that in euery habitation there were
great store of people.
<span class="sidenote">Acuco as Gomara writeth is on a strong
mountaine.</span>
He shewed me a towne
which was in a mountaine, and told me that there
was there great store of people of bad conditions,
which made continual warre vpon them: which being without a
gouernour, and dwelling in that desert place, where small store
of Maiz groweth, came downe into the playne to buy it in trucke
of Deeres skinnes, wherewith they were apparelled with long
garments, which they did cutte with rasors, and sewed with
needles made of Deeres bones: and that they had great houses
of stone. I asked them whether there were any there of
that Countrey; and I found one woman which ware a
garment like a little Mantle, which clad her from the waste
downe to the ground, of a Deeres skin well dressed.
Then I asked him whether the people which dwelt on the riuers
side, dwelt alwayes there, or els sometime went to dwell in some
other place: he answered me, that in the summer season they
aboade there, and sowed there; and after they had gathered in
their croppe they went their way, and dwelt in other houses which
they had at the foote of the mountaine farre from the riuer. And
hee shewed me by signes that the houses were of wood compassed
<!--399.png-->
<span class="pagenum">403</span>
with earth without, and I vnderstood that they made a
round house, wherein the men and women liued all together. I
asked him whether their women were common or no: he tolde
me no, and that hee which was married, was to haue but one
wife only. I desired to know what order they kept in marying:
and he tolde me, that if any man had a daughter to marry, he
went where the people kept, and said, I haue a daughter to
marry, is there any man here that wil haue her? And if there
were any that would haue her, he answered that he would haue
her: and so the mariage was made.
<span class="sidenote">Dancing and singing at mariages of the
Sauages.</span>
And that the father of him
which would have her, brought something to giue the yong
woman; and from that houre forward the mariage
was taken to be finished, and that they sang and
danced: and that when night came, the parents tooke
them, and left them together in a place where no body
might see them. And I learned that brethren, and sisters, and
kinsfolk married not together: and that maydes before they were
married conuersed not with men, nor talked not with them, but
kept at home at their houses and in their possessions, and
wrought: and that if by chance any one had company with men
before she were married, her husband forsooke her, and went
away into other Countreyes: and that those women which fell
into this fault, were accompted naughty packs. And that if
after they were maried, any man were taken in adultery with
another woman, they put him to death: and that no
man might haue more that one wife, but very secretly.
<span class="sidenote">They burne their dead.</span>
They tolde mee that they burned those which dyed:
and such as remayned widowes, stayed halfe a yeere, or a whole
yeere before they married. I desired to know what they
thought of such as were dead. Hee told me that they went to
another world, but that they had neither punishment nor glory.
The greatest sicknesse that this people dye of is vomiting of
blood by the mouth: and they haue Physicions which cure them
with charmes and blowing which they make.
<span class="sidenote">Pipes to drinke Tabacco with.</span>
The
apparell of these people were like the former: they
carried their pipes with them to perfume themselues,
like as the people of New Spaine vse Tabacco. I inquired
whether they had any gouernour, and found that
they had none, but that every family had their seuerall
gouernour.
<span class="sidenote">Maize, gourds, Mill.</span>
These people haue besides their Maiz
certaine gourds, and another corne like vnto Mill:
<span class="sidenote">Grindestones, earthern pots, good fish.</span>
they haue
<!--400.png-->
<span class="pagenum">404</span>
grindstones and earthern pots, wherein they boyle those
gourds, and fish of the riuer, which are very good. My
interpreter could goe no farther then this place: for he
said that those which we should find farther on our way,
were their enemies, and therefore I sent him backe very well contented.
Not long after I espied many Indians to come crying
with a loude voice, and running after me.
<span class="sidenote">This riuer ouerfloweth his banks at certaine
seasons.</span>
I stayed to know what
they would haue; and they told me that they had set vp the
crosse which I had giuen them, in the midst of their dwellings
as I had appointed, but that I was to wit, that when
the riuer did ouerflow, it was wont to reach to that
place, therefore they prayed mee to giue them leaue
to remove it, and to set it in another place where the
riuer could not come at it, nor carry it away: which
I granted them.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 5.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">Of an Indian of that countrey they haue relation of the state of
Ceuola, and of the conditions and customes of these
people, and of their gouernour: and likewise of the
countreys not farre distant from thence, whereof one was
called Quicoma, and the other Coama: of the people of
Quicoma, and of the other Indians not farre distant they
receiue courtesie.</div>

<p>Thus sayling I came where were many Indians, and another
interpreter, which I caused to come with me in my boat. And
because it was cold, and my people were wet, I leapt on shore,
and commanded a fire to be made, and as we stood thus warming
our selues, an Indian came and strooke me on the arme, pointing
with his finger to a wood, out of which I saw two companies of
men come with their weapons, and he told me that they came to
set vpon vs: and because I meant not to fall out with any of
them, I retired my company into our boats, and the Indians
which were with me swam into the water, and saued themselues
on the other side of the riuer. In the meane season I inquired
of that Indian which I had with me, what people they were that
came out of the wood: and he told me that they were their
enemies, and therefore these others at their approch without
saying any word leapt into the water: and did so, because they
<!--401.png-->
<span class="pagenum">405</span>
meant to turne backe againe, being without weapons, because
they brought none with them, because they vnderstood my wil
and pleasure, that they should cary none. I inquired the same
things of this interpreter which I had done of the other of the
things of that countrey, because I vnderstood that among some
people one man vsed to haue many wiues, and among others but
one.
<span class="sidenote">Ceuola 40 dayes iourney from thence by the
riuer.</span>
Now I vnderstood by him, that he had bin at
Ceuola, and that it was a moneths iourney from his
country, and that from that place by a path that
went along that riuer a man might easily trauel
thither in xl. daies, and that the occasion that moued him to go
thither, was only to see Ceuola, because it was a great thing, and
had very hie houses of stone of 3. or 4. lofts, and windowes on
ech side; that the houses were compassed about with a wall conteining
the height of a man and an halfe, and that aloft and
beneath they were inhabited with people, and that they vsed the
same weapons, that others vsed, which we had seene, that is to
say, bowes and arrowes, maces, staues and bucklers:
<span class="sidenote">Turqueses in Ceuola.</span>
and that
they had one gouernor, and that they were apparelled with
mantles, and with oxe-hides, and that their mantles had a
painting about them, and that their gouernour ware a long shirt
very fine girded vnto him, and ouer the same diuers mantles:
and that the women ware very long garments, and that they were
white, and went all couered: and that euery day many Indians
wayted at the gate of their gouernour to serue him,
and that they did weare many Azure or blew stones,
which were digged out of a rocke of stone, and that
they had but one wife, with whom they were maried, and
that when their gouernors died, all the goods that they had
were buried with them. And likewise all the while they eate,
many of their men waite at their table to court them, and see
them eate, and that they eate with napkins, and that they haue
bathes. On Thursday morning at breake of day the Indians
came with the like cry to the banke of the riuer, and with
greater desire to serue vs, bringing me meat to eat, and making
me the like good cheere, which the others had done vnto me,
hauing vnderstood what I was: and I gaue them crosses, with
the self same order which I did vnto the former. And going
farther vp the riuer I came to a country where I found better
gouernment: for the inhabitants are wholly obedient vnto one
only. But returning againe to conferre with mine interpreter
<!--402.png-->
<span class="pagenum">406</span>
touching the dwellings of those of Ceuola, he tolde me, that the
lord of that countrey had a dog like that which I caried with
me.
<span class="sidenote">This was the Negro that went with Frier Marco de
Niza.</span>
Afterward when I called for dinner, this interpreter saw
certaine dishes caried in the first and later seruice, whereupon he
told me that the lord of Ceuola had also such as those were,
but that they were greene, and that none other had of them
sauing their gouernour, and that they were 4, which he had
gotten together with that dogge, and other things, of
a blacke man which had a beard, but that he knew
not from what quarter he came thither, and that the
king caused him afterward to be killed, as he heard
say. I asked him whether he knew of any towne
that was neere vnto that place: he tolde me that aboue the
riuer he knew some, and that among the rest there was a lord of
a towne called Quicoma, and another of a towne called Coama:
and that they had great store of people vnder them. And after
he had giuen me this information, he craued leaue of me to
returne vnto his companions. From hence I began againe to
set saile, and within a dayes sayling I found a towne dispeopled:
where assoone as I was entred, by chance there arriued there
500. Indians with their bowes and arrowes, and with them was
that principal Indian called Naguachato, which I had left behind,
and brought with them certaine conies and yucas: and after I
had friendly interteined them all, departing from them, I gaue
them license to returne to their houses. As I passed further by
the desert, I came to certain cotages, out of which much people
came toward me with an old man before them, crying in a
language which mine interpreter wel vnderstood, and he said
vnto those men: Brethren, you see here that lord; let vs giue
him such as we haue, seeing he dooth vs pleasure, and hath
passed through so many discourteous people, to come to visit vs.
And hauing thus said, he offred to the Sunne, and then to me in
like sort as the rest had done. These had certaine great bags
and well made of the skins of fishes called Sea-bremes. And I
vnderstood that this was a towne belonging vnto the lord of
Quicoma, which people came thither onely to gather the fruit of
their haruest in summer; and among them I found one which
vnderstood mine interpreter very well: whereupon very easily I
gaue them the like instruction of the crosse which I had giuen
to others behind. These people had cotton, but they were not
very carefull to vse the same: because there was none among
<!--403.png-->
<span class="pagenum">407</span>
them that knew the arte of weauing, and to make apparel thereof.
They asked me how they should set vp their crosse when they
were come to their dwelling which was in the mountaine, and
whether it were best to make an house about it, that it might
not be wet, and whether they should hang any thing vpon the
armes therof. I said no; and that it sufficed to set it in a place
where it might be seene of all men, vntill I returned: and lest
peraduenture any men of warre should come that way, they
offred mee more men to goe with me, saying that they were
naughty men which I should finde aboue; but I would haue
none: neuerthelesse 20. of them went with me, which when I
drew neere vnto those which were their enemies, they warned
mee thereof: and I found their centinels set vpon their guarde
on their borders. On Saturday morning I found a great squadron
of people sitting vnder an exceeding great arbour, and another
part of them without: and when I saw that they rose not vp, I
passed along on my voyage: when they beheld this an old man
rose vp which said vnto me, Sir, why doe you not receiue victuals
to eate of vs, seeing you haue taken food of others? I answered,
that I tooke nothing but that which was giuen me, and that I
went to none but to such as requested me. Here without any
stay they brought me victuals, saying vnto me, that because I
entred not into their houses, and stayed all day and all night in
the riuer, and because I was the sonne of the Sunne, all men
were to receiue me for their lord. I made them signes to sit
down, and called that old man which mine interpreter vnderstood,
and asked him whose that countrey was, and whether the lord
thereof was there, he said yes: and I called him to me; and
when he was come, I imbraced him, shewing him great loue:
and when I saw that all of them tooke great pleasure at the
friendly interteinment which I gaue him, I put a shirt vpon him,
and gaue him other trifles, and willed mine interpreter to vse the
like speaches to that lord which he had done to the rest; and
that done, I gaue him a crosse, which he receiued with a very
good wil, as the others did: and this lord went a great way with
me, vntill I was called vnto from the other side of the riuer,
where the former old man stood with much people: to whom I
gaue another crosse, vsing the like speach to them which I had
vnto the rest, to wit, how they should vse it. Then following
my way, I mette with another great company of people, with
whom came that very same olde man whom mine interpreter
<!--404.png-->
<span class="pagenum">408</span>
vnderstood; and when I saw their lord which he shewed vnto
me, I prayed him to come with me into my boat, which he did
very willingly, and so I went still vp the riuer, and the olde man
came and shewed me who were the chiefe lords: and I spake
vnto them alwayes with great courtesie, and all of them shewed
that they reioyced much thereat, and spake very wel of my
comming thither. At night I withdrew my selfe into the midst
of the riuer, and asked him many things concerning that country:
and I found him as willing and wel disposed to shew them me,
as I was desirous to know them.
<span class="sidenote">Ceuola a goodly thing.</span>
I asked him of
Ceuola: and he told me he had bin there, and that
it was a goodly thing, and that the lord thereof was
very wel obeyed: and that there were other lords thereabout,
with whom he was at continual warre. I asked him whether
they had siluer and gold, and he beholding certain bels, said
they had metal of their colour.
<span class="sidenote">Gold and siluer in a mountaine neere
Ceuola.</span>
I inquired whether they made it
there and he answered me no, but that they brought
it from a certain mountaine, where an old woman
dwelt.
<span class="sidenote">This riuer seemeth to bee Northward by the
colde.</span>
I demanded whether he had any knowledge
of a riuer called Totonteac, he answered me no, but
of another exceeding mighty riuer, wherein there were such huge
Crocodiles, that of their hides they made bucklers, and that they
worship the Sunne neither more nor lesse then those which I
had passed: and when they offer vnto him the fruits of the
earth, they say: Receiue hereof, for thou hast created
them, and that they loued him much, because he
warmed them; and that when he brake not foorth,
they were acolde. Herein reasoning with him, he
began somewhat to complaine, saying vnto me, I
know not wherefore the Sunne vseth these termes with vs, because
he giueth vs not clothes, nor people to spin nor to weaue them,
nor other things which he giueth to many other, and he complayned
that those of that country would not suffer them to
come there, and would not giue them of their corne. I told
him that I would remedie this, whereat he remayned very well
satisfied.</p>

<p>The next day which was Sunday before breake of day, began
their cry as they were woont: and this was the cry of 2. or 3.
sorts of people, which had lyen all night neere the riuers side,
wayting for me: and they tooke Maiz and other corne in their
mouth, and sprinkled me therewith, saying that that was the
fashion which they vsed when they sacrificed vnto the Sunne:
afterward they gaue me of their victuals to eat, and among other
things, they gaue me many white peason. I gaue them a crosse
as I had done to the rest: and in the meane season that old
man tolde them great matters of my doing, and poynted me out
with his finger, saying, this is the lord, the sonne of the Sunne:
and they made me to combe my beard, and to set mine apparel
handsomely which I ware vpon my backe. And so great was the
confidence that they had in me, that all of them told me what things
had passed, and did passe among them, and what good or bad mind
they bare one toward another. I asked them wherefore they imparted
vnto me all their secrets, and that old man answered mee:
Thou art our lord, and we ought to hide nothing from our lord. After
these things, following on our way, I began againe to inquire of
him the state of Ceuola, and whether he knewe that those of this
countrey had euer seene people like vnto vs: he answered me
no, sauing one Negro which ware about his legs and armes
certain things which did ring.
<span class="sidenote">The Negro that went with Frier Marco de Niza

I demanded vpon what occasion
<!--406.png-->
<span class="pagenum">410</span>
he was killed; and he answered me, That the lord of Ceuola
inquired of him whether he had other brethren: he
answered that he had an infinite number, and that
they had great store of weapons with them, and that
they were not very farre from thence. Which when
he had heard, many of the chiefe men consulted
together, and resolued to kil him, that he might not giue newes
vnto these his brethren, where they dwelt, and that for this cause
they slew him, and cut him into many pieces, which were diuided
among all those chiefe lords, that they might know assuredly that
he was dead: and also that he had a dogge like mine, which he
likewise killed a great while after. I asked him whether they of
Ceuola had any enemies, and he said they had. And he
reckoned vnto me 14. or 15. lords which had warre with them:
and that they had mantles, and bowes like those aboue mentioned:
howbeit he told me that I should find going vp the riuer a people
that had no warre neither with their neighbors, nor with any
other.
<span class="sidenote">Antonio d'Espejo speaketh of such a great
lake.</span>
He told me that they had 3. or 4. sorts of trees bearing
most excellent fruite to eate: and that in a certaine lake dwelt
an olde woman, which was much honoured and worshipped of
them: and that shee remayned in a litle house which was there,
and that she neuer did eate any thing: and that there they made
things which did sound, and that many mantles, feathers and
Maiz were giuen vnto her. I asked what her name was, and he
tolde me that she was called Guatuzaca, and that thereabout
were many lords which in their life and death, vsed
the like orders which they of Ceuola did, which had
their dwelling in the summer with painted mantles,
and in the winter dwelt in houses of wood of 2. or 3.
lofts hie: and that he had seene all these things, sauing the
old woman. And when againe I began to aske him more
questions, he would not answere me, saying that he was wearie
of me: and many of those Indians comming about me,
they said among themselues: Let vs marke him well, that
we may knowe him when he commeth back againe. The
Monday following, the riuer was beset with people like to them,
and I began to request the old man to tell me what people
were in that countrey, which told me he thought I would soone
forget them: and here he reckoned vp vnto me a great number
of lords, and people at the least 200. And discoursing with
him of their armour, he said that some of them had certaine
<!--407.png-->
<span class="pagenum">411</span>
very large targets of lether, aboue two fingers thicke.
<span class="sidenote">This might be the crooke backed oxe of

I
asked him of what beasts skinne they made them: and he
discribed vnto me a very great beast, like vnto an Oxe,
but longer by a great handfull, with broad feete, the
legs as bigge as the thigh of a man, and the head
seuen handfuls long, the forehead of three spannes,
and the eyes bigger then ones fist, and the hornes of the length
of a mans leg, out of which grew sharpe poynts, an handfull
long, the forfeete and hinderfeete aboue seuen handfuls bigge,
with a wrethed tayle, but very great; and holding vp his armes
aboue his head, he said the beast was higher then that. After
this hee gaue mee information of another olde woman which
dwelt toward the sea side. I spent this day in giuing crosses to
those people as I had done vnto the former. This old man that
was with me leapt on shore, and fell in conference with another
which that day had often called him; and here both of them
vsed many gestures in their speach, moouing their armes, and
poynting at me.
<span class="sidenote">The Sauages treasons to be taken heede of.</span>
Therefore I sent mine interpreter out, willing
him to drawe neere vnto them, and listen what they said; and
within a while I called him, and asked him whereof they talked,
and he sayd, that he which made those gestures said vnto the
other, that in Ceuola there were others like vnto vs with beards,
and that they said they were Christians, and that both of
them sayd that we were all of one company, and
that it were a good deede to kill vs, that those others
might haue no knowledge of vs, lest they might
come to doe them harme: and that the old
man had answered him, this is the sonne of the Sunne, and our
lord, he doth vs good, and wil not enter into our houses,
although we request him thereunto: he will take away nothing
of ours, he wil meddle with none of our women, and that to be
short, he had spoken many other things in my commendation
and fauour: and for all this the other stedfastly affirmed that we
were all one, and that the old man said, Let vs goe vnto him,
and aske him whether he be a Christian as the other be, or els
the sonne of the Sonne: and the old man came vnto me, and
sayd: In the countrey of Ceuola whereof you spake
vnto me doe other men like vnto you dwell.
<span class="sidenote">Certaine newes of the Spanyards at Ceuola.</span>
Then
I began to make as though I wondred, and answered
him, that it was impossible; and they assured me
that it was true, and that two men had seene them which came
<!--408.png-->
<span class="pagenum">412</span>
from thence, which reported that they had things which did
shoote fire, and swords as we had. I asked them whether they
had seene them with their owne eyes? and they answered no;
but that certaine of their companions had seene them. Then
hee asked mee whether I were the sonne of the Sunne, I
answered him yea. They said that those Christians of Ceuola
said so likewise. And I answered them that it might well be.
Then they asked mee if those Christians of Ceuola came to ioyne
themselues with me, whether I would ioyne with them: and I
answered them, that they needed not to feare any whit at all, for
if they were the sonnes of the Sunne as they said, they must
needes be my brethren, and would vse towards all men the like
loue and courtesie which I vsed: whereupon hereat they seemed
to be somewhat satisfied.</p>

<div class="c3">Chap. 7.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">It is tolde him that they are ten dayes iourney distant from Ceuola,
and that there be Christians there, which make warre against

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Ceuola tenne dayes distant from this place. A
desert of ten dayes iourney.</span>
Then I prayed them to tel me how many dayes that kingdom
of Ceuola, which they spake of, was distant from that
riuer: and that man answered, that there was the
space of tenne dayes iourney without habitation, and
that he made none accompt of the rest of the way,
because there were people to be found. Vpon this
aduertisement I was desirous to certifie Captaine
Francis Vazquez of my being there, and imparted my mind with
my souldiers, among whom I found none that was willing to goe
thither, although I offered them many rewards in your lordships
name, onely one Negro slaue though with an euil wil offred himselfe
vnto me to go thither: but I looked for the comming of
those two Indians which they tolde me of, and herewithall we
went on our way vp the riuer against the streame in such sort as
<!--409.png-->
<span class="pagenum">413</span>
we had done before. Here that olde man shewed me as a
strange thing a sonne of his clad in womans apparel, exercising
their office: I asked him how many there were of these among
them, and he told me there were foure; and that when any of
them died, there was a search made of all the women with child
which were in the country, and that the first sonne which was
borne of them, was appoynted to doe that duetie belonging vnto
women, and that the women clad him in their apparell, saying,
that seeing he was to doe that which belonged to them, he should
weare their apparel: these yong men may not haue carnall copulation
with any woman: but all the yong men of the countrey
which are to marrie, may company with them. These men
receiue no kind of reward for this incestuous act of the people of
that countrey, because they haue libertie to take whatsoeuer they
find in any house for their food. I saw likewise certaine women
which liued dishonestly among men: and I asked the old man
whether they were married, who answered me noe, but they were
common women, which liued apart from the married women. I
came at length after these discourses to pray them to send for
those Indians, which they said had bin at Ceuola, and they
told me that they were eight dayes iourney distant from
that place, but that notwithstanding there was one among them
which was their companion and which had spoken with them, as he
met them on the way, when they went to see the kingdome of
Ceuola, and that they told him that he were not best to goe any
farther, for he should find there a fierce nation like vs: and of the
same qualities and making, which had fought much with the
people of Ceuola, because they had killed a Negro of their company
saying, Wherefore haue yee killed him? what did he to you? did
he take any bread from you, or do you any other wrong? and
such like speech. And they said moreouer, that these people
were called Christians, which dwelt in a great house, and that
many of them had oxen like those of Ceuola, and other litle
blacke beastes with wooll and hornes, and that some of them had
beasts which they rode vpon, which ran very swiftly; and that
one day before their departure, from sunne rising vntill sunne
setting these Christians were all day in comming thither, and all
of them lodged in that place where others had lodged, and that
these two met with two Christians, which asked them whence
they were, and whether they had fields sowen with corne: and
they told them that they dwelt in a farre country, and that they
<!--410.png-->
<span class="pagenum">414</span>
had corne, and that then they gaue each of them a litle cap and
they gaue them another to cary to their other companions, which
they promised to do, and departed quickly. When I vnderstood
this, I spoke againe with my company, to see if any one of them
would go thither, but I found them vnwilling as at the first, and
they layd against me greater inconueniences.
<span class="sidenote">A desert.</span>
Then I called the
old man to see if he would giue me any people to goe with me,
and victuals to trauel through that wildernes, but he
laid before me many inconueniences and dangers,
which I might incurre in that voyage, shewing me the danger
that there was in passing by a lord of Cumana, which threatned
to make warre vpon them, because his people had entred into
the others country to take a stagge, and that I should not therefore
depart thence without seeing him punished. And when I
replied that in any wise I must needes goe to Ceuola, he willed
me to surcease from that purpose, for they looked that that lord
without a doubt would come to annoy them, and that therefore
they could not leaue their countrey naked to goe with me, and
that it would be better, that I would make an end of that warre
betweene them, and that then I might haue their company
to Ceuola. And vpon this point we grew to such variance,
that we began to grow into choler, and in a rage he
would haue gone out of the boat, but I stayed him,
and with gentle speeches began to pacifie him, seeing that it
imported mee much to haue him my friend: but for all my
courtesies which I shewed him, I could not alter him from his
mind, wherein he stil remained obstinate. In the meane while
I sent a man away vnto my ships to giue them knowledge of the
iourney that I had determined to make. After this I prayed the
old man that he would fetch him backe again, because I had
determined, that seeing I saw no meanes to be able to go to
Ceuola, and because I would stay no longer among those people
because they should not discouer me, and likewise because I
meant in person to visit my ships, with determination to returne
againe vp the riuer, carying with me other companions, and
leaue there some which I had sicke, and telling the olde man
and the rest that I would returne, and leauing them satisfied the
best I could (although they alwayes said that I went away for
feare) I returned downe the riuer: and that way which I had
gone against the streame vp the riuer in 15 dayes and an halfe,
<span class="sidenote">He returneth in 2 dayes and an halfe to his
ships.</span>
I
made in my returne in 2 dayes and an halfe, because the streame
<!--411.png-->
<span class="pagenum">415</span>
was great and very swift. In this wise going downe
the riuer, much people came to the banks, saying, Sir,
wherefore doe you leaue vs? what discourtesie hath
bin done vnto you? did you not say that you would
remayne continually with vs, and be our Lord;
And turne backe again? if any man aboue the riuer hath done
you any wrong we will goe with our weapons with you and kill
him; and such like words ful of loue and kindnes.</p>

<div class="DescrHdr2">When they came to their shippes the Captaine named the coast

courteously.</div>

<p>Vpon mine arriuall at my ships I found all my people in
health, although very heauie for my long stay, and because the
current had fretted fower of their cables, and that they had lost
two ankers which were recouered. After we had brought our
ships together, I caused them to bring them into a good harbour,
and to giue the carena to the shippe called Sanct Peter, and to
mend all that were needfull. And here assembling all my company
together, I opened vnto them what knowledge I had
receiued of Francis Vasquez; and how it might be that in those
sixeteene dayes space which I was in sayling vp the riuer he
might peraduenture haue some knowledge of me, and that I was
minded to returne vp the riuer once againe to try if I could
finde any means to ioyne myself with him: and although some
spake against my determination, I caused al my boates to bee
made ready, because the ships had no need of them.
<span class="sidenote">Mark what things the Spaniardes cary with them in

I caused one of them to be filled with wares of exchange,

and cockes of Castile, and departed vp the riuer,

and called it the Chappell of our Lady de la Buena Guia, and

mayor, to take the height of the pole. And I departed on
Tuesday the fourteenth of September, and on Wednesday I came
vnto the first dwellings of the first Indians, which came running
to hinder my passage, supposing that we had bene other people,
for we caried with vs a fifer, and a drummer, and I was clad in
other apparell, then I went in before, when they saw me first of
all: and when they knew me they stayed, though I could not
grow vnto perfect friendship with them, whereupon I gaue some
of those seedes which I brought with mee; teaching them how
they should sow them, and after I had sayled 3 leagues, my
first interpretour came euen to my boat to seeke me with great
ioy, of whom I demanded wherefore he had left me, he tolde me
that certaine companions of his had led him away. I made him
good countenance and better intertainment, because he should
beare me companie againe, considering howe much it did importe
me to haue him with me.
<span class="sidenote">Parrats in these parts.</span>
He excused himselfe because
he stayed there to bring mee certaine feathers of
Parrats, which he gaue me.
<span class="sidenote">Two moones to Ceuola.</span>
I asked him what
people these were, and whether they had any Lord:
hee answered me yea; and named three or foure vnto me, of
24 or 25 names of people which he knew and that they had
houses painted within, and that they had trafficke
with those of Ceuola, and that in two moones he
came into the countrey.
<span class="sidenote">Another booke written of the particulars of that
countrey.</span>
He told me moreouer
many other names of Lords, and other people,
which I haue written downe in a booke of mine,
which I will bring myselfe vnto your Lordship. But
I thought good to deliuer this brief relation to
Augustine Guerriero in this hauen of Colima, that he
might send it ouerland to your Lordshippe, to whom
I haue many other things to imparte.</p>

<p>But to returne to my iourney, I arrived at Quicama, where the
Indians came forth with great ioy and gladnes to receive me,
aduertizing me that their Lord waited for my comming; to whom
when I was come I found that he had with him fiue or sixe
thousand men without weapons, from whom he went aparte with some
two hundred onely, all which brought victuals with them, and so
he came towards me, going before the rest with great authoritie,
and before him and on each side of him were certaine which
made the people stand aside, making him way to passe. Hee
ware a garment close before and behind and open on both sides,
<!--413.png-->
<span class="pagenum">417</span>
fastened with buttons, wrought with white and blacke checker
worke, it was very soft and well made, being of the skinnes of
certaine delicate fishes called Sea breams. Assoone as he was
come to the waters side his seruants tooke him vp in their armes,
and brought him into my boate, where I embraced him and receiued
him with great ioy, shewing vnto him much kindnesse:
vpon which intertainment his people standing by and beholding
the same seemed not a litle to reioyce. This Lord turning himselfe
to his people willed them to consider my courtesie, and
that he being of his owne accord come vnto me with a strange
people, they might see how good a man I was, and with how
great loue I had entertained him, and that therefore they should
take me for their Lord, and that all of them should become my
seruants, and doe whatsoever I would command them. There I
caused him to sit downe, and to eat certaine conserues of sugar
which I had brought with mee, and willed the interpreter to
thanke him in my name for the fauour which he had done me in
vouchsafing to come to see mee, recommending vnto him
the worshipping of the crosse, and all such other things as I
had recommended to the rest of the Indians; namely that they
should liue in peace, and should leaue off warres, and
should continue alwayes good friendes together: he answered
that of long time they had continued in warres with their neighbours,
but that from thence forward he would command his
people that they should giue food to all strangers that passed
through his kingdome, and that they should doe them no kinde
of wrong, and that if any nation should come to inuade him, he
said he would tell them howe I had commanded that they should
liue in peace, and if they refused the same, he would defend
himselfe, and promised me, that he would neuer goe to seeke
warre, if others came not to invade him. Then I gaue him
certaine trifles, as well of the seedes which I brought, as of the
hens of Castile, wherewith he was not a litle pleased. And at
my departure I caryed certaine of his people with me, to make
friendship betweene them and those other people which dwelt
aboue the Riuer: and here the interpreter came vnto me, to
craue leaue to returne home: and I gaue him certaine gifts
wherewith he departed greatly satisfied.</p>

<p>The next day I came to Coama, and many of them knew me
not, seeing me clad in other aparrel, but the old man which was
there as soone as he knew me leapt into the water, saying vnto
<!--414.png-->
<span class="pagenum">418</span>
me, Sir, lo here is the man which you left with me, which came
forth very ioyfull and pleasant declaring vnto me the great
courtesies which that people had shewed him, saying that they
had strouen together who should haue him to his house, and
that it was incredible to thinke what care they had at the rising
of the Sunne to hold vp their hands and kneele before the
Crosse. I gaue them of my seedes and thanked them hartily for
the good entertainement which they had shewed my man, and
they besought me that I would leaue him with them, which I
granted them vntill my return, and he stayed among them very
willingly.
<span class="sidenote">Treason of the sauages.</span>
Thus I went forward vp the Riuer, taking that olde
man in my companie, which tolde mee, that two Indians came
from Cumana to enquire for the Christians, and that he had
answered them that he knew none such, but that he
knew one which was the sonne of the Sunne, and
that they had perswaded him to ioyne with them to
kill mee and my companions. I wished him to lend me two
Indians, and I would send word by them, that I would come
vnto them, and was desirous of their friendship, but that if they
on the contrary would haue warre, I would make such a warre
with them, that should displease them. And so I passed
through all that people, and some came and asked me, why I
had not giuen them Crosses as well as the rest, and so I gaue
them some.</p>

error of the Pilots of Cortez as touching the situation of
this Coast.</div>

<p>The next day I went on land to see certaine cottages, and I
found many women and children holding vp their hands and
kneeling before a Crosse which I had giuen them. When I
came thither I did the like my self; and conferring with the old
<!--415.png-->
<span class="pagenum">419</span>
man, he began to informe me of as many people and Prouinces
as he knew. And when euening was come I called the old man
to come and lodge with mee in my boate; hee answered that
hee would not goe with mee because I would wearie him with
asking him questions of so many matters: I told him that I
would request him nothing else but that he would set me downe
in a chart as much as he knew concerning that Riuer, and what
maner of people those were which dwelt vpon the banckes
thereof on both sides: which he did willingly. And then he
requested me that I would describe my countrey vnto him, as
he had done his vnto me. And for to content him, I caused a
draught of certaine things to be made for him. The next day I
entred betweene certaine very high mountaines, through which
this Riuer passeth with a streight chanel, and the boats went vp
against the streame very hardly for want of men to draw the
same. Here certaine Indians came and told me, that in the
same place there were certaine people of Cumana, and among
the rest an enchanter, who enquired which way we would passe;
and they telling him that we meant to passe by the Riuer, he set
certaine canes on both sides thereof, through which wee passed,
without receiuing any kinde of domage which they intended
against vs. Thus going forward I came vnto the house of the
olde man which was in my company, and here I caused a very
high crosse to be set vp, whereupon I engraued certaine letters
to signifie that I was come thither: and this I did, that if by
chance any of the people of the generall Vasquez de Coronado
should come thither, they might haue knowledge of my being
there. At length seeing I could not attaine to the knowledge of
that which I sought for, I determined to returne backe vnto my
ships. And being ready to depart there arriued two Indians,
which by meanes of the interpreters of the old man, told me that
they were sent to me, and that they were of Cumana, and that
their Lord could not come himselfe, because he was farre from
that place, but desired me to signifie vnto him what my pleasure
was. I told them, that I wished that he would alwayes imbrace
peace, and that I was comming to see that countrey, but being
inforced to returne backe downe the Riuer I could not now doe
it, but that hereafter I would returne, and that in the meane
season they should giue that Crosse vnto their Lorde, which
they promised me to do, and they went directly to cary him that
Crosse with certaine feathers which were on the same.
<span class="sidenote">This Riuer ran much farther vp then he had
trauelled.</span>
Of these
<!--416.png-->
<span class="pagenum">420</span>
I sought to vnderstand what people dwelt vpward
vpon the bankes of the Riuer, which gaue me knowledge
of many people, and told me that the Riuer
went farre more vp into the land then I had yet
seene, but that they knew not the head thereof,
because it was very far into the countrey, and that many other
Riuers fell into the same.</p>

<p>Hauing learned thus much the next day morning I returned
downe the Riuer, and the day following I came where I had left
my Spaniard, with whom I spake, and told him that all things
had gone well with me, and that at this time and the former I
had gone aboue 30 leagues into the countrey. The Indians of
that place inquired of me what the cause was of my departure,
and when I would returne: to whom I answered, that I would
returne shortly. Thus sayling downe the streame, a woman
leapt into the water crying vnto vs to stay for her, and shee
came into our boate, and crept vnder a bench, from whence we
could not make her to come out: I understood that shee did
this, because her husband had taken vnto him another wife, by
whom hee had children, saying that she ment not to dwell any
longer with him, seeing he had taken another wife. Thus shee
and another Indian came with me of their owne accord, and so
I came into my ships, and making them ready we proceeded
home on our voyage, coasting and oftentimes going on land, and
entering a great way into the countrey, to see if I could learne
any newes of Captaine Francis Vasquez and his companie; of
whom I could haue no other knowledge, but such as I learned
in the aforesaide Riuer. I bring with me many actes of taking
possession of all that Coast. And by the situation of the Riuer,
and the height which I tooke, I finde that that which the Masters
and Pilots of the Marquesse tooke is false, and that they were
deceiued by 2 degrees, and I haue sayled beyond them aboue 4
degrees. I sayled vp the Riuer 85 leagues, where I saw and
learned all the particulars before mentioned, and many other
things; whereof when it shall please God to giue me leaue to
kisse your Lordships hands, I will deliuer you the full and perfect
relation. I thinke my selfe to haue had very good fortune, in
that I found Don Luis de Castilia, and Augustine Ghenero in
the port of Colima: for the Galiot of the Adelantado came vpon
mee, which was there with the rest of his fleet, and commanded
me to strike sayle, which seeming a strange thing vnto me, and
<!--417.png-->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
not vnderstanding in what state things were in Nueua Espanna, I
went about to defend my selfe, and not to doe it. In the meane
while came Don Luis de Castilia in a boate and conferred with
mee, and I lay at anchor on the other side of the hauen where
the saide fleete road, and I gaue vnto him this relation (and to
auoyd striffe I determined to sayle away by night) which relation
I caryed about me briefly written; for I alwayes had a purpose
to send the same, as soone as I should touch vpon Nueua
Espanna, to aduertise your Lordship of my proceedings.</p>

in Nueua Espanna in October 1597, touching the discouerie
of the rich Isles of California, being distant eight
dayes sayling from the maine.</div>

<p>We haue seene a letter written the eight of October 1597, out
of a towne called Pueblo de los Angeles situate eighteene leagues
from Mexico, making mention of the Ilands of California situate
two or three hundreth leagues from the maine land of Nueua
Espanna, in Mar del Sur: as that thither haue bene sent before
that time some people to conquer them: which with losse of some
twentie men were forced backe. After that they had wel visited
and found those Islands or countreys to be very rich of gold and
siluer mynes, and of very fayre Orientall pearles, which were
caught in good quantitie vpon one fathome and an halfe passing
in beautie the pearles of the Island Margarita: the report thereof
caused the Vice-roy of Mexico to send a citizen of Mexico with
two hundreth men to conquer the same. Therein also was
affirmed that within eight dayes they could sayle thither from the
mayne.</p>

The course which Sir Francis Drake held from the hauen of
Guatulco in the South sea on the backe side of Nueua
Espanna, to the North-west of California as far as fourtie
three degrees: and his returne back along the said Coast
to thirtie eight degrees: where finding a faire and goodly
hauen, he landed, and staying there many weekes, and
discouering many excellent things in the countrey and
great shewe of rich minerall matter, and being offered the
dominion of the countrey by the Lord of the same, hee
tooke possession thereof in the behalfe of her Maiestie,
and named it Noua Albion.</div>

<p>Wee kept our course from the Isle of Cano (which lyeth in
<!--418.png-->
<span class="pagenum">422</span>
eight degrees of Northerly latitude, and within two leagues of the
maine of Nicaragua, where wee calked and trimmed our ship)
along the Coast of Nueua Espanna, vntill we came to the Hauen
and Towne of Guatulco, which (as we were informed) had but
seuenteene Spaniards dwelling in it, and we found it to stand in
fifteene degrees and fiftie minutes.</p>

<p>Assoone as we were entred this Hauen we landed, and went
presently to the towne, and to the Towne house, were we
found a Iudge sitting in iudgement, he being associate with
three other officers, vpon three Negroes that had conspired the
burning of the Towne: both which Iudges, and prisoners we
tooke, and brought them a shippeboord, and caused the chiefe
Iudge to write his letter to the Towne, to command all the
Townesmen to auoid, that we might safely water there. Which
being done, and they departed, wee ransaked the Towne, and in
one house we found a pot of the quantitie of a bushell full of
royals of plate, which we brought to our ship.</p>

<p>And here one Thomas Moone one of our companie, took a
Spanish gentleman as he was flying out of the Towne, and
searching him he found a chaine of Gold about him, and other
jewels, which we tooke and so let him goe.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The Portugal Pilote set on land.</span>
At this place our Generall among other Spaniards, set ashore
his Portugall Pilote, which he tooke at the Island of
Cape Verde, out of a ship of Saint Marie port of
Portugall, and hauing set them ashoore, we departed
thence.</p>

<p>Our General at this place and time thinking himselfe both in
respect of his priuate injuries receiued from the Spaniards, as also
of their contempts and indignities offered to our Countrey and
Prince in generall, sufficiently satisfied, and reuenged: and
supposing that her Maiestie at his returne would rest contented
with this seruice, purposed to continue no longer vpon the Spanish
coastes, but began to consider and to consult of the best way for
his Countrey.</p>

<p>He thought it not good to returne by the Streights, for two
speciall causes: the one, least the Spaniards should there waite,
and attend for him in great number and strength, whose handes
he being left but one ship, could not possibly escape. The other
cause was the dangerous situation of the mouth of the Streits of
the South side, with continuall stormes raining and blustring, as
he found by experience, besides the shoals and sands vpon the
<!--419.png-->
<span class="pagenum">423</span>
coast, wherefore he thought it not a good course to aduenture
that way: he resolued therefore to auoide these hazards, to goe
forward to the Islands of the Malucos, and therehence to saile
the course of the Portugales by the Cape of Bona Speran&ccedil;a.</p>

<p>Vpon this resolution, he began to thinke of his best way for
the Malucos, and finding himselfe, where hee now was, becalmed,
hee sawe that of necessitie hee must bee enforced to take a
Spanish course, namely to saile somewhat Northerly to get a
good winde, and thus much we sayled from the 16 of Aprill after
our olde stile till the third of Iune.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Sir Francis Drake sayled on the backe side of
America, to 43 degrees of Northerly latitude. 38 degrees.</span>
The fift day of Iune being in fortie three degrees
towardes the pole Arcticke, being speedily come out
of the extreame heate, wee found the ayre so colde,
that our men being pinched with the same, complayned
of the extremitie thereof, and the further we
went, the more the colde increased vpon vs, whereupon
we thought it best for that time to seeke land,
and did so, finding it not mountainous, but low plaine
land, and we drew backe againe without landing, til we came
within thirtie eight degrees towardes the line. In which height
it pleased God to send vs into a faire and good Bay, with a good
winde to enter the same.</p>

<p>In this Bay wee ankered the seuententh of Iune, and the
people of the Countrey, hauing their houses close by the waters
side, shewed themselues vnto vs, and sent a present to our
Generall.</p>

<p>When they came vnto vs, they greatly wondred at the things
which we brought, but our Generall (according to his naturall
and accustomed humanitie) curteously intreated them, and
liberally bestowed on them necessarie things to couer their
nakednesse, whereupon they supposed vs to be gods, and would
not be perswaded to the contrary: the presentes which they sent
vnto our Generall were feathers, and cals of net worke.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A description of the people and Countrey of Noua
Albion.</span>
Their houses are digged round about with earth,
and haue from the vttermost brimmes of the circle
clifts of wood set vpon them, ioyning close together
at the toppe like a spire steeple, which by reason of
that closenesse are very warme.</p>

<p>Their bed is the ground with rushes strawed on it, and lying
about the house, they haue the fire in the middest. The men
goe naked, the women take bulrushes and kembe them after the
<!--420.png-->
<span class="pagenum">424</span>
maner of hempe, and thereof make their loose garments, which
being knit about their middles, hang downe about their hippes,
hauing also about their shoulders a skinne of Deere, with the
haire vpon it. These women are very obedient and seruiceable
to their husbands.</p>

<p>After they were departed from vs, they came and visited vs the
second time, and brought with them feathers and bags of Tabacco
for presents: And when they came to the toppe of the hil (at the
bottome whereof wee had pitched our tents) they stayed themselues,
where one appointed for speaker, wearied himselfe with
making a long oration, which done, they left their bowes vpon
the hill and came downe with their presents.</p>

<p>In the meane time the women remaining on the hill, tormented
themselues lamentably, tearing their flesh from their cheekes,
whereby we perceiued that they were about a sacrifice. In the
meane time our Generall, with his companie, went to prayer, and
to reading of the Scriptures, at which exercise they were attentiue
and seemed greatly to be affected with it: but when they were
come vnto vs they restored againe vnto vs those things which
before we had bestowed vpon them.</p>

<p>The newes of our being there being spread through the
countrey, the people that inhabited round about came downe,
and amongst them the king himself, a man of a goodly stature,
and comely personage, with many other tall and warlike men:
before whose comming were sent two Ambassadours to our
Generall, to signifie that their king was comming, in doing of
which message, their speech was continued about halfe an howre.
This ended, they by signes requested our Generall to send something
by their hand to their king, as a token that his comming
might bee in peace: wherein our Generall hauing satisfied them,
they returned with glad tidings to their king, who marched to vs
with a princely Maiestie, the people crying continually after their
maner, and as they drewe neere vnto vs, so did they striue to
behaue themselues in their actions with comelinesse.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">These are like chaines of Esurnoy in Canada and
Hochelage.</span>
In the fore front was a man of a goodly personage, who bare
the scepter, or mace before the king, whereupon hanged two
crownes, a lesse and a bigger, with three chaines of
a marueilous length: the crownes were made of knit
work wrought artificially with feathers of diuers
colours: the chaines were made of a bony substance
and few be the persons among them that are admitted
<!--421.png-->
<span class="pagenum">425</span>
to weare them: and of that number also the persons are stinted,
as some ten, some twelue, &amp;c. Next vnto him which bare the
scepter, was the king himselfe, with his Guarde about his person,
clad with Conie skinnes, and other skinnes: after them followed
the naked common sort of people, euery one hauing his face
painted, some with white, some with blacke, and other colours,
and hauing in their hands one thing or other for a present, not
so much as their children, but they also brought their presents.</p>

<p>In the meane time, our Generall gathered his men together,
and marched within his fenced place, making against their
approching, a very warlike shewe. They being trooped together
in their order, and a general salutation being made, there was
presently a generall silence. When he that bare the scepter
before the king, being informed by another, whome they assigned
to that office, with a manly and loftie voice, proclaimed that
which the other spake to him in secret, continuing halfe an
houre: which ended, and a generall Amen as it were giuen, the
king with the whole number of men, and women (the children
excepted) came downe without any weapon, who descending to
the foote of the hill, set themselues in order.</p>

<p>In comming towards our bulwarks and tents, the scepter
bearer began a song, obseruing his measures in a dance, and that
with a stately countenance, whom the king with his Garde, and
euery degree of persons following, did in like maner sing and
dance, sauing onely the women which daunced and kept silence.
The General permitted them to enter within our bulwark, where
they continued their song and daunce a reasonable time. When
they had satisfied themselues, they made signes to our Generall
to sit downe, to whom the king, and diuers others made seueral
orations, or rather supplication, that he would take their prouince
and kingdom into his hand, and become their king, making
signes that they would resigne vnto him their right and title of
the whole land, and become his subiects.
<span class="sidenote">The king resignes his crowne and kingdome to Sir
Frances Drake. Great riches in Noua Albion.</span>
In which
to perswade vs the better, the king and the rest, with
one consent and with great reuerence, ioyfully singing
a song, did set the crowne vpon his head,
inriched his necke with all their chaines, and offered
vnto him many other things, honouring him by the
name of Hioh, adding thereunto as it seemed a signe
of triumph: which thing our Generall thought not meete to
reiect, because hee knewe not what honour and profite it might
<!--422.png-->
<span class="pagenum">426</span>
bee to our countrey. Wherefore in the name, and to the vse of
her Maiestie, he tooke the scepter, crowne and dignitie of the
said Countrey in his hands, wishing that the riches and treasure
thereof might so conueniently be transported to the inriching of
her kingdome at home, as it aboundeth in the same.</p>

<p>The common sort of the people leauing the king and his
Guarde with our Generall, scattered themselues together with
their sacrifices among our people, taking a diligent viewe of
euery person; and such as pleased their fancie, (which were the
yongest) they inclosing them about offred their sacrifices vnto
them with lamentable weeping, scratching, and tearing the flesh
from their faces with their nayles, whereof issued abundance of
blood. But wee vsed signes to them of disliking this, and stayed
their hands from force, and directed them vpwardes to the
liuing God, whome onely they ought to worshippe. They
shewed vnto vs their wounds, and craued helpe of them at our
handes, whereupon wee gaue them lotions, plaisters, and
ointments agreeing to the state of their griefes, beseeching God
to cure their deseases. Euery thirde day they brought their
sacrifices vnto vs, vntill they vnderstoode our meaning, that we
had no pleasure in them: yet they could not be long absent from
vs, but daily frequented our company to the houre of our departure,
which departure seemed so grieuous vnto them, that
their ioy was turned into sorrow. They intreated vs, that being
absent wee would remember them, and by stelth prouided a
sacrifice, which we misliked.</p>

<p>Our necessarie businesse being ended, our Generall with his
companie traueiled vp into the Countrey to their villages, where
we found heardes of Deere by a thousand in a companie, being
most large and fat of body.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Abundance of strange conies.</span>
We found the whole countrey to bee a warren of a strange
kinde of Conies, their bodyes in bignes as be the Barbary
Conies, their heads as the heades of ours, the feet of
a Want, and the taile of a Rat being of great length:
vnder her chinne on either side a bagge, into the
which shee gathereth her meate when she hath filled her belly
abroad. The people eate their bodies, and make great account
of their skinnes, for their Kings coate was made of them.</p>

<p>Our Generall called this countrey, Noua Albion, and that for
two causes: the one in respect of the white bankes and cliffes,
which lye towardes the sea: and the other, because it might haue
<!--423.png-->
<span class="pagenum">427</span>
some affinitie with our Countrey in name, which sometimes was
so called.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Golde and siluer in the earth of Noua
Albion.</span>
There is no part of earth heere to be taken vp,
wherein there is not some special likelihood of gold
or siluer.</p>

<p>At our departure hence our Generall set vp a
monument of our being there; as also of her Maiesties right and
title to the same, namely a plate nailed vpon a faire great poste,
whereupon was ingrauen her Maiesties name, the day and yeere
of our arriuall there, with the free giuing vp of the Prouince and
people into her Maiesties hands, together with her highnesse
picture and armes, in a piece of sixe pence of current English
money vnder the plate, where vnder was also written the name
of our Generall.</p>

<p>It seemeth that the Spaniards hitherto had neuer bene in this
part of the countrey, neither did euer discouer the land by many
degrees to the Southwards of this place.</p>

IN THE YEERE 1595 BY SIR WALTER RALEGH KNIGHT,
CAPTAINE OF HER MAIESTIES GUARD, LORDE WARDEN OF
THE STANNERIES, AND HER HIGHNESSE LIEUTENANT
GENERALL OF THE COUNTIE OF CORNE-WALL.</div>

<div class="DescrHdr2">To the right Honourable my singular good Lord and kinsman
Charles Howard, Knight of the Garter, Baron and
Counceller, and of the Admirals of England the most
renowmed: and to the right Honourable Sir Robert
Cecyll knight, Counceller in her Highnesse Priuie
Councils.</div>

<p>For your Honours many Honourable and friendly partes, I
haue hitherto onely returned promises, and now for answere of
both your adventures, I haue sent you a bundle of papers, which
I haue deuided betwene your Lordship, and Sir Robert Cecyll in
these two respects chiefly: First for that it is reason, that wastful
factors, when they haue consumed such stockes as they had in
trust, doe yeeld some colour for the same in their account;
secondly for that I am assured, that whatsoeuer shall bee done,
or written by me, shall neede a double protection and defence.
The triall that I had of both your loues, when I was left of all,
but of malice and reuenge, makes me still presume, that you wil
be pleased (knowing what litle power I had to performe ought,
and the great aduantage of forewarned enemies) to answer that
out of knowledge, which others shal but obiect out of malice.
In my more happy times as I did especially Hon. you both, so I
found that your loues sought mee out in the darkest shadow of
aduersitie, and the same affection which accompanied my better
<!--425.png-->
<span class="pagenum">429</span>
fortune, sored not away from me in my many miseries: al which
though I can not requite yet I shal euer acknowledge: and the
great debt which I haue no power to pay, I can do no more for a
time but confesse to be due. It is true that as my errors were
great, so they haue yeelded very grieuous effects, and if ought
might haue bene deserued in former times to haue conterpoysed
any part of offences, the fruit thereof (as it seemeth) was long
before fallen from the tree, and the dead stocke onely remained.
I did therefore euen in the winter of my life, vndertake these
trauels, fitter for bodies lesse blasted with misfortunes, for men
of greater abilitie, and for minds of better incouragement, that
thereby, if it were possible, I might recouer but the moderation
of excesse, and the least tast of the greatest plenty formerly possessed.
If I had knowen other way to win, if I had imagined
how greater aduentures might haue regained, if I could conceiue
what farther meanes I might yet vse, but euen to appease so
powerful displeasure, I would not doubt but for one yeere more
to hold fast my soule in my teeth, till it were performed. Of
that litle remaine I had, I haue wasted in effect all herein. I
haue vndergone many constructions. I haue been accompanyed
with many sorrows, with labour, hunger, heat, sicknes, and perill:
It appeareth notwithstanding that I made no other brauado of
going to the sea, then was ment, and that I was neuer hidden in
Cornewall, or els where, as was supposed. They haue grosly
belied me, that foreiudged, that I would rather become a seruant
to the Spanish King, then returne, and the rest were much mistaken,
who would haue perswaded, that I was too easefull and
sensuall to vndertake a iourney of so great trauell. But, if what
I haue done, receiue the gracious construction of a painefull
pilgrimage, and purchase the least remission, I shall thinke all too
litle, and that there were wanting to the rest many miseries. But
if both the times past, the present, and what may be in the future,
doe all by one grain of gall continue in eternall distaste; I doe
not then know whether I should bewaile my selfe, either for my
too much trauell and expence, or condemne my selfe for doing
lesse then that, which can deserue nothing. From my selfe I
haue deserued no thankes, for I am returned a begger, and
withered, but that I might haue bettred my poore estate, it shall
appeare by the following discourse, if I had not onely respected
her Maiesties future Honour, and riches. It became not the
former fortune in which I once liued, to goe iourneys of picory,
<!--426.png-->
<span class="pagenum">430</span>
it had sorted ill with the offices of Honour, which by her
Maiesties grace I hold this day in England, to run from Cape to
Cape, and from place to place, for the pillage of ordinaries prizes.
Many yeeres since, I had knowledge by relation, of that mighty,
rich and beautifull Empier of Guiana, and of that great and
golden Citie, which the Spaniards call El Dorado, and the
naturals Manoa, which Citie was conquered, reedified, and inlarged
by a yonger sonne of Guainacapa Emperour of Peru, at
such time as Francisco Pi&ccedil;arro and others conquered the said
Empire, from his two elder brethren, Guascar, and Atabalipa,
both then contending for the same, the one being fauoured by
the Orejones of Cuzco, the other by the people of Caxamalca.
I sent my seruant Iacob Whiddon the yere before, to get knowledge
of the passages, and I had some light from Captaine
Parker, sometime my seruant, and nowe attending on your Lordship,
that such a place there was to the Southward of the great
Bay of Charuas, or Guanipa: but I found that it was 600 miles
farther off then they supposed, and many other impediments to
them vnknowen and vnheard. After I had displanted Don
Antonio de Berreo, who was vpon the same enterprize, leauing
my ships at Trinidad at the Port called Curiapan, I wandred 400
miles into the said countrey by lande and riuer: the particulars I
will leaue to the following discourse. The countrey hath more
quantity of gold by manifolde, then the best partes of the Indies,
or Peru: All the most of the kings of the borders are already
become her Maiesties vassals: and seeme to desire nothing more
then her Maiesties protection and the returne of the English
nation. It hath another ground and assurance of riches and
glory, then the voyages of the West Indies, an easier way to inuade
the best parts thereof, then by the common course. The
king of Spaine is not so impouerished, by taking three or foure
Port townes in America, as wee suppose, neither are the riches of
Peru, or Nueua Espanna so left by the sea side, as it can bee
easily washt away with a great flood, or springtide, or left dry
vpon the sandes on a lowe ebbe. The Port townes are fewe and
poore in respect of the rest within the lande, and are of litle
defence, and are onely rich, when the Fleets are to receiue the
treasure for Spaine: and we might thinke the Spaniards very
simple, hauing so many horses and slaues, if they could not vpon
two dayes warning cary all the golde they haue into the land, and
farre enough from the reach of our foote-men, especially the
<!--427.png-->
<span class="pagenum">431</span>
Indies being (as they are for the most part) so mountainous, so
full of woodes, riuers, and marishes. In the Port townes of the
Prouince of Vene&ccedil;uela, as Cumana, Coro and S. Iago (whereof
Coro and S. Iago were taken by Captaine Preston, and Cumana
and S. Iosepho by vs) we found not the value of one riall of
plate in either: but the Cities of Barquasimeta, Valencia, S.
Sebastian, Cororo, S. Lucia, Laguna, Maracaiba, and Truxillo,
are not so easely inuaded: neither doeth the burning of those on
the coast impouerish the king of Spaine any one ducat: and if
we sacke the riuer of Hacha, S. Marta, and Cartagena, which are
the Portes of Nueuo reyno, and Popayan; there are besides
within the land, which are indeed riche and populous the townes
and Cities of Merida, Lagrita, S. Christophoro, the great Cities
of Pamplon, S. Fe de Bogota, Tunxa and Mozo where the Esmeralds
are found, the townes and Cities of Marequita, Velez, la
Villa de Leua, Palma, Vnda, Angustura, the great citie of
Timana, Tocaima, S. Aguila, Pasto, Iuago, the great Citie of
Popaian it selfe, Los Remedios, and the rest. If we take the
Ports and villages within the Bay of Vraba in the kingdom or
riuers of Dariene, and Caribana, the Cities and townes of S. Iuan
de Roydas, of Cassaris, of Antiocha, Caramanta, Cali, and
Anserma haue gold enough to pay the kings part, and are not
easily inuaded by the way of the Ocean: or if Nombre de Dios
and Panama be taken in the Prouince of Castilla del oro, and
the villages vpon the riuers of Cenu and Chagre; Peru hath
besides those and besides the magnificent cities of Quito
and Lima so many ylands, ports, cities, and mines, as
if I should name them with the rest, it would seem
incredible to the reader; of all which, because I haue
written a particular treatise of the West Indies, I wil
omit the repetition at this time, seeing that in the said treatise I
haue anatomised the rest of the sea-townes, aswel of Nicaragua,
Iucatan, Nueua Espanna, and the ylands, as those of the Inland,
and by what meanes they may be best inuaded, as far as any
meane iudgment can comprehend. But I hope it shal appeare
that there is a way found to answer euery mans longing, a better
Indies for her Maiestie then the King of Spaine hath any: which
if it shal please her highnes to vndertake, I shall most willingly
end the rest of my daies in folowing the same: if it be left to the
spoile and sackage of common persons, if the loue and seruice of
so many nations be dispised, so great riches, and so mighty an
<!--428.png-->
<span class="pagenum">432</span>
empire refused, I hope her maiesty wil yet take my humble
desire and my labor therin in gracious part, which, if it had not
bin in respect of her highnes future honor and riches, could haue
laid hands on and ransomed many of the kings and Casiqui of
the country, and haue had a reasonable proportion of gold for
their redemption: but I haue chosen rather to beare the burden
of pouerty, then reproch, and rather to endure a second traue
and the chances therof, then to haue defaced an enterprise of so
great assurance, vntil I knew whether it pleased God to put a
disposition in her princely and royal heart either to folow or
foreslow the same: I wil therefore leaue it to his ordinance that
hath only power in all things, and do humbly pray that your
honors wil excuse such errors, as without the defence of art,
ouerrun in euery part of the folowing discourse, in which I haue
neither studied phrase, forme or fashion, that you will be pleased
to esteeme mee as your owne (though ouer dearly bought) and
I shall euer remaine ready to do you all honour and seruice.</p>

<div class="center">Â¶ To the Reader.</div>

<p>Because there haue bin diuers opinions conceiued of the
gold oare broght from Guiana, and for that an Alderman of
London and an officer of her Maiesties Mint, hath giuen out
that the same is of no price, I haue thought good by the addition
of these lines to giue answer aswel to the said malicious slander,
as to other obiections. It is true that while we abode at the
yland of Trinidad, I was informed, by an Indian, that not far
from the Port, where we ancored, there were found certaine
mineral stones which they esteemed to be gold, and were thereunto
perswaded the rather for that they had seene both English
and Frenchmen gather, and imbark some quantities therof: vpon
this likelyhood I sent 40. men and gaue order that each one
should bring a stone of that mine to make trial of the goodnes:
which being performed, I assured them at their returne that the
same was Marcasite, and of no riches or value: notwithstanding
diuers, trusting more to their owne sence, then to my opinion,
kept of the said Marcasite, and haue tried therof since my returne
in diuers places. In Guiana it selfe I neuer saw Marcasite,
but al the rocks, mountains, al stones in the plaines, woods, and
by the riuers side are in effect throughshining, and seem
<!--429.png-->
<span class="pagenum">433</span>
maruelous rich, which being tried to be no Marcasite, are the true
signes of rich minerals, but are no other then El madre del oro
(as the Spaniards terme them) which is the mother of gold, or as
it is said by others the scum of gold: of diuers sorts of these
many of my company brought also into England, euery one
taking the fairest for the best, which is not general. For mine own
part I did not countermand any mans desire, or opinion, and I
could haue aforded them litle if I should haue denied them the
pleasing of their owne fancies therein: but I was resolued that
gold must be found either in graines separate from the stone (as
it is in most of the riuers of Guiana) or els in a kind of hard
stone, which we call The white spar, of which I saw diuers hils,
and in sundry places, but had neither time nor men, nor instruments
fit for labour. Neere vnto one of the riuers I found of
the said White sparre or flint a very great ledge or banke, which
I endeuoured to breake by al the meanes I could, because there
appeared on the outside some smal graines of golde, but finding
no meane to worke the same vpon the vpper part, seeking the
sides and circuit of the said rocke, I found a clift in the same
from whence with daggers, and with the head of an axe, we got
out some smal quantitie therof, of which kind of white stone
(wherin gold engendred) we saw diuers hils and rocks in
euery part of Guiana, wherein we traueiled. Of this there
haue bin made many trials, and in London it was first
assaid by M. Westwood a refiner dwelling in Woodstreet,
and it held after the rate of 12000. or 13000. pounds a tunne.
Another sort was afterward tried by M. Bulmar and M. Dimock
Assay-master, and it held after the rate of 23000 li. a tunne.
There was some of it againe tried by M. Palmer comptroller of
the Mint, and M. Dimock in goldsmiths hal, and it held after
26900. li. a tun. There was also at the same time, and by the
same persons a trial made of the dust of the said mine which
held 8. li. 6. ounces weight of gold in the 100: there was likewise
at the same time a triall of an image of copper made in Guiana,
which held a third part of gold, besides diuers trials made in the
countrey, and by others in London. But because there came ill
with the good, and belike the said Alderman was not presented
with the best, it hath pleased him therefore to scandall all the
rest, and to deface the enterprize as much as in him lieth. It
hath also bene concluded, by diuers, that if there had bin any
such oare in Guiana, and the same discouered, that I would haue
<!--430.png-->
<span class="pagenum">434</span>
brought home a greater quantitie thereof: first I was not bound
to satisfie any man of the quantitie, but such only as aduentured,
if any store had bin returned thereof: but it is very true that had
al their mountaines bene of massie gold, it was impossible for vs
to haue made any longer stay to haue wrought the same: and
whosoeuer hath seene with what strength of stone the best gold
oare is inuironed, hee will not thinke it easy to be had out in
heapes, and especially by vs, who had neither men, instruments,
nor time (as it is said before) to performe the same. There were
on this discouery no lesse then 100. persons, who can all
witnesse, that when we past any branch of the riuer to view the
land within, and staied from our boats but 6. houres, wee were
driuen to wade to the eyes, at our returne: and if we attempted
the same, the day following it was impossible either to ford it, or
to swim it, both by reason of the swiftnesse, and also for that the
borders were so pestred with fast woods, as neither boat nor man
could find place, either to land or to imbarke: for in Iune, Iuly,
August and September, it is impossible to nauigate any of those
riuers: for such is the fury of the current, and there are so many
trees and woods ouerflowne, as if any boat but touch vpon any
tree or stake, it is impossible to saue any one person therein: and
yer [ed: before] we departed the land it ranne with such swiftnes,
as wee draue downe most commonly against the
wind, little lesse then 100. miles a day: Besides our
were no other then whirries, one little barge, a small cockboat,
and a bad Galiota, which we framed in hast for that purpose at
Trinidad, and those little boats had 9. or 10. men a piece, with
all their victuals, and armes. It is further true, that we were
about 400. miles from our ships, and had bene a moneth from
them, which also we left weakly manned in an open road, and
had promised our returne in 15. dayes. Others haue deuised
that the same oare was had from Barbary, and that we caried it
with vs into Guiana: surely the singularitie of that deuice I doe
not well comprehend: for mine owne part, I am not so much in
loue with these long voyages, as to deuise, therby to cozen my
selfe, to lie hard, to fare worse, to be subiected to perils, to
diseases, to ill sauors, to be parched and withered, and withall to
sustaine the care and labour of such an enterprize, except the
same had more comfort, then the fetching of Marcasite in Guiana,
<!--431.png-->
<span class="pagenum">435</span>
or buying of gold oare in Barbary. But I hope the better sort
will judge me by themselves, and that the way of deceit is not
the way of honour or good opinion: I have herein consumed
much time, and many crownes, and I had no other respect or
desire then to serue her Majestie and my country thereby. If
the Spanish nation had bene of like beliefe to these detracters,
we should litle have feared or doubted their attempts, wherewith
we now are daily threatned. But if we now consider of the
actions both of Charles the 5. who had the maidenhead of Peru,
and the abundant treasures of Atabalipa, together who the affaires
of the Spanish king now liuing, what territories he hath purchased,
what he hath added to the acts of his predecessors, how
many kingdoms he hath indangered, how many armies, garisons,
and nauies he hath and doth mainteine, the great losses which
he hath repaired, as in 88. aboue 100 saile of great ships with
their artillery, and that no yere is lesse vnfortunate but that many
vessels, treasures, and people are deuoured, and yet notwithstanding
he beginneth againe like a storme to threaten shipwrack to vs
all: we shall find that these abilities rise not from the trades of
sacks, and Siuil oringes, nor from ought els that either Spaine,
Portugal, or any of his other prouinces produce: it is his Indian
gold that indangereth and disturbeth all the nations of Europe,
it purchaseth intelligence, creepeth into counsels, and setteth
bound loyaltie at libertie, in the greatest Monarchies of Europe.
If the Spanish king can keepe vs from forren enterprizes, and
from the impeachment of his trades, either by offer of inuasion,
or by besieging vs in Britaine, Ireland, or elsewhere, hee hath
then brought the worke of our peril in great forwardnes. Those
princes which abound in treasure haue great aduantages ouer the
rest, if they once constraine them to a defensiue war, where they
are driuen once a yere or oftener to cast lots for their own garments,
and from such shal all trades and entercourse be taken
away, to the general losse and impouerishment of the kingdom
and common weale so reduced: besides when our men are constrained
to fight, it hath not the like hope, as when they are
prest and incouraged by the desire of spoile and riches. Farther,
it is to be douted how those that in time of victory seeme to
affect their neighbor nations, wil remaine after the first view of
misfortunes, or il successe; to trust also to the doubtfulnes of a
battel, is but a fearefull and vncertaine adventure, seeing therein
fortune is as likely to preuaile, as vertue. It shall not be necessary
<!--432.png-->
<span class="pagenum">436</span>
to alleage all that might bee said, and therefore I will thus
conclude, that whatsoeuer kingdome shall be inforced to defend
it selfe, may be compared to a body dangerously diseased, which
for a season may be preserued with vulgar medicines, but in a
short time, and by litle and litle, the same must needs fall to the
ground, and be dissolued. I have therefore laboured all my
life, both according to my smal power, and perswasion, to aduance
al those attempts, that might either promise return of profit to
our selues, or at least be a let and impeachment to the quiet
course and plentifull trades of the Spanish nation, who in my
weake judgement by such a warre were as easily indangered and
brought from his powerfulnes, as any prince of Europe, if it be
considered from how many kingdoms and nations his reuenues
are gathered, and those so weake in their owne beings, and so
far seuered from mutual succour. But because such a preparation
and resolution is not to be hoped for in hast, and that the
time which our enemies imbrace, cannot be had againe to
aduantage, I wil hope that these prouinces, and that Empire
now by me discouered shal suffice to inable her Maiestie and
the whole kingdome, with no lesse quantities of treasure, then
the king of Spaine hath in all the Indies East and West, which
he possesseth, which if the same be considered and followed,
ere the Spaniards enforce the same, and if her Maiestie wil
vndertake it, I wil be contented to lose her highnesse fauour and
good opinion for euer, and my life withall, if the same be not
found rather to exceed, then to equal, whatsoeuer is in this discourse
promised or declared. I will now referre the Reader to
the following discourse, with the hope that the perillous and
chargeable labours and indeuors of such as thereby seeke the
profit and honour of her Maiestie, and the English nation, shall
by men of qualitie and vertue receiue such construction, and
good acceptance, as themselves would looke to be rewarded
withall in the like.</p>

<div class="c3">Â¶ The discouerie of Guiana.</div>

<p>On Thursday the 6. of February in the yeere 1595. we
departed England, and the Sunday following had sight of the
North cape of Spaine, the winter for the most part continuing
prosperous: we passed in sight of the Burlings, and the Rocke,
<!--433.png-->
<span class="pagenum">437</span>
and so onwards for the Canaries, and fel with Fuerte ventura
the 17 of the same moneth, where we spent two or three dayes,
and relieued our companies with some fresh meat. From thence
we coasted by the Grand Canaria, and so to Tenerif, and stayed
there for the Lions whelpe your Lordships ship, and for Captaine
Amyas Preston and the rest.
<span class="sidenote">The yle of Trinidad.</span>
But when after 7. or 8. dayes
wee found them not, we departed and directed our
course for Trinidad with mine owne ship, and a small
barke of Captaine Crosses onely (for we had before
lost sight of a small Galego on the coast of Spaine, which came
with vs from Plimmouth) we arriued at Trinidad the 22. of
March, casting ancker at point Curiapan, which the Spaniards
call punta de Gallo, which is situate in 8. degrees or there
abouts: we abode there 4. or 5. dayes, and in all that time we
came not to the speach of any Indian or Spaniard: on the
coast we saw a fire, as we sailed from the point Caroa towards
Curiapan, but for feare of the Spaniards none durst come to
speake with vs. I my selfe coasted it in my barge close abord
the shore and landed in euery Coue, the better to know the
yland, while the ships kept the chanell. From Curiapan after a
fewe dayes we turned vp Northeast to recouer that place which
the Spaniards call Puerto de los Espannoles, and the inhabitants
Conquerabia, and as before (reuictualling my barge) I left the
ships and kept by the shore, the better to come to speach with
some of the inhabitants, and also to vnderstand the riuers, watering
places, and ports of the yland, which (as it is rudely done)
my purpose is to send your Lordship after a few dayes. From
Curiapan I came to a port and seat of Indians called Parico,
where we found a fresh water riuer, but saw no people. From
thence I rowed to another port, called by the naturals Piche,
and by the Spaniards Tierra de Brea: In the way betweene both
were diuers little brookes of fresh water and one salt riuer that
had store of oisters vpon the branches of the trees, and were
very salt and well tasted. All their oisters grow vpon those
boughs and spraies, and not on the ground: the like is commonly
seene in other places of the West Indies, and else where.
This tree is described by Andrew Theuet in his French Antarctique,
and the forme figured in the booke as a plant very strange,
and by Plinie in his 12. booke of his naturall historie. But in
this yland, as also in Guiana there are very many of them.</p>

<p>At this point called Tierra de Brea or Piche there is that
<!--434.png-->
<span class="pagenum">438</span>
abundance of stone pitch, that all the ships of the world may be
therewith loden from thence, and we made trial of it in trimming
our shippes to be most excellent good, and melteth not with the
Sunne as the pitch of Norway, and therefore for shippes trading
the South parts very profitable. From thence wee went to the
mountaine foote called Anniperima, and so passing the riuer
Carone on which the Spanish Citie was seated, we met with our
ships at Puerto de los Espannoles or Conquerabia.</p>

<p>This yland of Trinidad hath the forme of a sheephooke,
and is but narrow, the North part is very mountainous, the soile
is very excellent and will beare suger, ginger, or any other
commoditie that the Indies yeeld. It hath store of deere, wilde
porks, fruits, fish and foule: It hath also for bread sufficient
maiz, cassaui, and of those rootes and fruites which are common
euery where in the West Indies. It hath diuers beastes which
the Indies haue not: the Spaniards confessed that they found
graines of golde in some of the riuers, but they hauing a purpose
to enter Guiana (the Magazin of all rich mettals) cared not to
spend time in the search thereof any further. This yland is
called by the people thereof Cairi, and in it are diuers nations:
those about Parico are called Iaio, those at Punta de Carao are
of the Arwacas, and betweene Carao and Curiapan they are
called Saluajos, betwene Carao and Punta de Galera are the
Nepoios, and those about the Spanish citie terme themselues
Carinepagotes: Of the rest of the nations, and of other ports and
riuers I leaue to speake here, being impertinent to my purpose,
and meane to describe them as they are situate in the particular
plot and description of the yland, three parts whereof I coasted
with my barge, that I might the better describe it.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The death of Captaine Whiddon.</span>
Meeting with the ships at Puerto de los Espannoles, we found
at the landing place a company of Spaniards who kept a guard at
the descent, and they offering a signe of peace, I sent Captaine
Whiddon to speake with them, whom afterward to my great griefe
I left buried in the said yland after my returne from
Guiana, being a man most honest and valiant. The
Spaniards seemed to be desirous to trade with vs,
and to enter into termes of peace, more for doubt of their owne
strength then for ought else, and in the ende vpon pledge, some
of them came abord: the same euening there stale also abord vs
in a small Canoa two Indians, the one of them being a Casique
or Lord of the people called Cantyman, who had the yeere before
<!--435.png-->
<span class="pagenum">439</span>
bene with Captaine Whiddon and was of his acquaintance. By
this Cantyman, wee vnderstood what strength the Spaniards had,
howe farre it was to their Citie, and of Don Antonio de Berreo
the gouernor, who was said to be slaine in his second attempt of
Guiana, but was not.</p>

<p>While we remained at Puerto de los Espannoles some
Spaniards came abord vs to buy linnen of the company, and
such other things as they wanted, and also to view our ships and
company, all which I entertained kindly and feasted after our
maner: by meanes whereof I learned of one and another as
much of the estate of Guiana as I could, or as they knew for
those poore souldiers hauing bene many yeeres without wine, a
few draughts made them merrie, in which mood they vaunted of
Guiana and of the riches thereof, and all what they knewe of the
wayes and passages, my selfe seeming to purpose nothing lesse
then the enterance or discouerie thereof, but bred in them an
opinion that I was bound onely for the reliefe of those English
which I had planted in Virginia, whereof the bruite was come
among them: which I had performed in my returne, if extremitie
of weather had not forst me from the said coast.</p>

<p>I found occasions of staying in this place for two causes: the one
was to be reuenged of Berreo, who the yere before 1594. had
betraied eight of Captaine Whiddons men, and tooke them while
he departed from them to seeke the Edward Bonauenture, which
arriued at Trinidad the day before from the East Indies:
<span class="sidenote">8 Englishmen betrayed by Antony Berreo.</span>
in
whose absence Berreo sent a Canoa abord the pinnesse onely
with Indians and dogs inuiting the company to goe
with them into the woods to kill a deare, who like
wise men in the absence of their Captaine followed
the Indians, but were no sooner one harquebuze shot
from the shore, but Berreos souldiers lying in ambush had them
al, notwithstanding that he had giuen his word to Captaine
Whiddon that they should take water and wood safely: the
other cause of my stay was, for that by discourse with the Spaniards
I dayly learned more and more of Guiana, of the riuers and
passages, and of the enterprise of Berreo, by what meanes or
fault he failed, and how he meant to prosecute the same.</p>

<p>While wee thus spent the time I was assured by another
Casique of the North side of the yland, that Berreo had sent to
Margarita and Cumana for souldiers, meaning to haue giuen mee
a cassado at parting, if it had bene possible. For although he
<!--436.png-->
<span class="pagenum">440</span>
had giuen order through all the yland that no Indian should
come abord to trade with me vpon paine of hanging and
quartering, (hauing executed two of them for the same, which I
afterwards founde) yet euery night there came some with most
lamentable complaints of his crueltie, how he had diuided the
yland and giuen to euery souldier a part, that hee made the
ancient Casiques which were Lords of the countrey to be their
slaues, that he kept them in chaines, and dropped their naked
bodies with burning bacon, and such other torments, which I
found afterwards to be true: for in the citie after I entred the
same there were 5. of the lords or litle kings (which they cal
Casiques in the West Indies) in one chaine almost dead of
famine, and wasted with torments: these are called in their owne
language Acarewana, and now of the late since English, French
and Spanish are come among them, they call themselues
Capitaines, because they perceiue that the chiefest of euery ship
is called by that name. Those fiue Capitaines in the chaine
were called Wannawanare, Carroaori, Maquarima, Tarroopanama,
and Aterima. So as both to be reuenged of the former wrong
as also considering that to enter Guiana by small boats, to depart
400. or 500. miles from my ships, and to leaue a garison in my
backe interrested in the same enterprize, who also dayly expected
supplies out of Spaine, I should haue sauored very much of the
asse:
<span class="sidenote">The Citie of S. Ioseph taken. Antony Berreo taken
prisoner.</span>
and therefore taking a time of most aduantage I set vpon
the Corps du guard in the euening, and hauing put them to the
sword, sent Captaine Calfield onwards with 60.
souldiers, and my selfe followed with 40. more and
so tooke their new City which they called S. Ioseph
by breake of day: they abode not any fight after a
fewe shot, and all being dismissed but onely Berreo
and his companion, I brought them with me abord,
and at the instance of the Indians I set their new citie of S.
Ioseph on fire.</p>

<p>The same day arriued Captaine George Gifford with your
Lordships ship, and Captaine Keymis whom I lost on the coast
of Spaine with the Galego, and in them diuers gentlemen and
others, which to our little armie was a great comfort and supply.</p>

<p>We then hasted away towards our purposed discouery, and
first I called all the Captaines of the yland together that were
enemies to the Spaniards: for there were some which Berreo had
brought out of other countreys, and planted there to eate out and
<!--437.png-->
<span class="pagenum">441</span>
wast those that were naturall of the place, and by my Indian
interpreter, which I caried out of England, I made them vnderstand
that I was the seruant of a Queene, who was the great
Casique of the North, and a virgine, and had more Casiqui vnder
her then there were trees in that yland: that shee was an
enemie to the Castellani in respect of their tyrannie and
oppression, and that she deliuered all such nations about her, as
were by them oppressed, and hauing freed all the coast of the
Northren world from their seruitude, had sent mee to free them
also, and withall to defend the countrey of Guiana from their
inuasion and conquest. I shewed them her Maiesties picture
which they so admired and honoured, as it had bene easie to haue
brought them idolatrous thereof.</p>

<p>The like and a more large discourse I made to the rest of the
nations both in my passing to Guiana, and to those of the
borders, so as in that part of the world her Maiestie is very
famous and admirable, whom they now call Ezrabeta Cassipuna
Aquerewana, which is as much as Elizabeth, the great princesse
or greatest commander. This done we left Puerto de los
Espannoles, and returned to Curiapan, and hauing Berreo my
prisoner I gathered from him as much of Guiana as he knew.</p>

<p>This Berreo is a gentleman wel descended, and had long
serued the Spanish king in Millain, Naples, the Low countreis
and elsewhere, very valiant and liberall, and a gentleman of great
assurednes, and of a great heart: I vsed him according to his
estate and worth in all things I could, according to the small
meanes I had.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Sir W. Ralegh passed 400. miles toward
Guiana.</span>
I sent Captaine Whiddon the yeere before to get what
knowledge he could of Guiana, and the end of my
iourney at this time was to discouer and enter the
same, but my intelligence was farre from trueth, for
the countrey is situate aboue 600. English miles
further from the Sea, then I was made beleeue it had bin, which
afterward vnderstanding to be true by Berreo, I kept it from the
knowledge of my company, who else would neuer haue bene
brought to attempt the same: of which 600. miles I passed 400.
leauing my ships so farre from mee at ancker in the Sea, which
was more of desire to performe that discouery, then of reason,
especially hauing such poore and weake vessels to transport our
selues in; for in the bottom of an old Galego which I
caused to be fashioned like a galley, and in one barge, two

persons and their victuals for a moneth in the same, being al
driuen to lie in the raine and weather, in the open aire, in
the burning Sunne, and vpon the hard bords, and to dresse our
meat, and to cary all maner of furniture in them, wherewith they
were so pestered and unsauory, that what with victuals being
most fish, with wette clothes of so many men thrust together, and
the heat of the Sunne, I will vndertake there was neuer any prison
in England, that could bee found more vnsauorie and lothsome,
especially to my selfe, who had for many yeeres before bene
dieted and cared for in a sort farre more differing.</p>

<p>If Captaine Preston had not bene perswaded that he should
haue come too late to Trinidad to haue found vs there (for the
moneth was expired which I promised to tary for him there ere
hee coulde recouer the coast of Spaine) but that it had pleased
God hee might haue ioyned with vs, and that we had entred the
countrey but some ten dayes sooner ere the Riuers were ouerflowen,
wee had aduentured either to haue gone to the great
Citie of Manoa, or at least taken so many of the other Cities and
townes neerer at hand, as would haue made a royall returne: but
it pleased not God so much to fauour mee at this time: if it
shall be my lot to prosecute the same, I shall willingly spend my
life therein, and if any else shalbe enabled thereunto, and conquere
the same, I assure him thus much, he shall perfourme
more then euer was done in Mexico by Cortez, or in Peru by
Pi&ccedil;arro, whereof the one conquered the Empire of Mutezuma,
the other of Guascar, and Atabalipa, and whatsoeuer prince shall
possesse it, that Prince shall be Lord of more golde, and of a
more beautifull Empire, and of more Cities and people, then
either the King of Spaine, or the great Turke.</p>

<p>But because there may arise many doubts, and how this
Empire of Guiana is become so populous, and adorned with so
many great Cities, townes, temples and treasures, I thought good
to make it knowen, that the Emperour now reigning is descended
from those magnificent princes of Peru, of whose large territories,
of whose policies, conquests, edifices, and riches Pedro de
Cie&ccedil;a, Francisco Lopez, and others haue written large discourses:
for when Francisco Pi&ccedil;arro, Diego Almagro and others conquered
the said Empire of Peru, and had put to death Atabalipa
sonne to Guaynacapa, which Atabalipa had formerly caused his
eldest brother Guascar to bee slaine, one of the yonger sonnes of
<!--439.png-->
<span class="pagenum">443</span>
Guaynacapa fled out of Peru, and tooke with him many thousands
of those souldiers of the Empire called Oreiones, and with those
and many others which followed him, he vanquished all that
tract and valley of America which is situate betweene the great
riuer of Amazones, and Baraquan, otherwise called Orenoque
and Marannon.</p>

<p>The Empire of Guiana is directly East from Peru towards the
Sea, and lieth under the Equinoctial line, and it hath more
abundance of golde then any part of Peru, and as many or more
great Cities then euer Peru had when it flourished most: it is
gouerned by the same lawes, and the Emperour and people
obserue the same religion, and the same forme and policies in
gouernment as were vsed in Peru, not differing in any part:
<span class="sidenote">The statelines of Manoa.</span>
and
I haue bene assured by such of the Spaniards as haue seene
Manoa the Imperial Citie of Guiana, which the
Spaniards call El Dorado, that for the greatnesse, for
the riches, and for the excellent seat, it farre exceedeth
any of the world, at least of so much of the world as is knowen
to the Spanish nation: it is founded vpon a lake of salt water of
200. leagues long like vnto Mare Caspium.
<span class="sidenote">Fran. Lopez de Gomera hist. gen. cap. 120.</span>
And if we compare
it to that of Peru, and but read the report of Francisco
Lopez and others, it will seeme more then
credible: and because we may iudge of the one by
the other, I thought good to insert part of the 120.
Chapter of Lopez in his generall historie of the Indies, wherein
he describeth the Court and magnificence of Guaynacapa,
ancestour to the Emperor of Guiana, whose very wordes are
these. Todo el seruicio de su casa, mesa, y cozina, era de oro,
y de plata, y quando menos de plata, y cobre por mas rezio.
Tenia en su recamara estatuas huecas de oro, que parecian
gigantes, y las figuaras al propio, y tamanno de quantos animales,
aues, arboles, y yeruas produze la tierra, y de quantos peces cria
la mar y aguas de sus reynos. Tenia assi mesmo sogas, costales,
cestas, y troxes de oro y plata, rimeros de palos de oro, que
parecissen lenna raiada para quemar. En fin no auia cosa en
su tierra, que no la tuuiesse do oro contrahecha: y aun dizen,
que tenian los Ingas vn vergel en vna Isla cerca de la Puna,
donde se yuan a holgar, quando querian mar, que tenia la
ortaliza, las flores, y arboles de oro y plata, inuencion y grandeza
hasta entonces nunca vista. Allende de todo esto tenia infinitissima,
cantitad de plata, y oro por labrar en el Cuzco, que se

perdio por la muerte de Guascar, car los Indios lo escondieron,
viendo que los Espannoles se lo tomauan, y embiauan a Espanna.
That is, All the vessels of his house, table and kitchin were of
gold and siluer, and the meanest of siluer and copper for
strength and hardnesse of metall. He had in his wardrobe
hollow statues of gold which seemed giants, and the figures in
proportion and bignesse of all the beasts, birds, trees and
hearbes, that the earth bringeth foorth: and of all the fishes that
the sea or waters of his kingdome breedeth. He had also ropes,
budgets, chestes and troughs of golde and siluer, heapes of
billets of gold, that seemed wood marked out to burne. Finally,
there was nothing in his countrey, whereof he had not the counterfait
in gold: Yea and they say, The Ingas had a garden of
pleasure in an yland neere Puna, where they went to recreat
themselues, when they would take the aire of the Sea, which had
all kinde of garden-hearbs, flowers and trees of golde and siluer,
an inuention, and magnificence till then neuer seene. Besides
all this, he had an infinite quantitie of siluer and golde vnwrought
in Cuzco which was lost by the death of Guascar, for the Indians
hid it, seeing that the Spaniards tooke it, and sent it into Spaine.</p>

<p>And in the 117. chapter Francisco Pi&ccedil;arro caused the gold
and siluer of Atabalipa to be weyed after he had taken it, which
Lopez setteth downe in these words following. Hallaron cinquenta
y dos mil marcos de buena plata, y vn millon y trezientos
veinte y seys mil, y quinientos pesos de oro, Which is: They
found fiftie and two thousand markes of good siluer, and one
million, and three hundred twenty and sixe thousand and fiue
hundred pezos of golde.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

These quotations show the riches of <i>Peru</i>, not of <i>El Dorado</i>. This was
the name given by the Spaniards in the sixteenth century to an imaginary
region somewhere in the interior of South America, between the Orinoco and
the Amazon, where gold and precious stones were supposed to be in such
abundance as to be had for merely picking them up. This story was communicated
by an Indian cacique to Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of the conquerer,
who sent Francisco Orellana down the Amazon River to discover this wonderful
land. Orellana followed the course of the Amazon down to the sea, but he
did not find El Dorado. The story, however, continued to be credited for
many years afterwards.</div>

<p>Now although these reports may seeme strange, yet if we
consider the many millions which are dayly brought out of Peru
into Spaine, wee may easily beleeue the same: for we finde that
by the abundant treasure of that countrey the Spanish king
<!--441.png-->
<span class="pagenum">445</span>
vexeth all the princes of Europe, and is become in a few yeeres,
from a poore king of Castile, the greatest monarch of this part of
the world, and likely euery day to increase, if other princes
forslow the good occasions offered, and suffer him to adde this
empire to the rest, which by farre exceedeth all the rest: if his
golde now endanger vs, hee will then be vnresistable. Such of
the Spanyards as afterward endeuoured the conquest thereof
(whereof there haue bene many, as shall be declared hereafter)
thought that this Inga (of whom this emperour now liuing is
descended) tooke his way by the riuer of Amazones, by that
branch which is called Papamene: for by that way followed
Orellana (by the commandement of Gonzalo Pi&ccedil;arro, in the yere
1542) whose name the riuer also beareth this day, which is also
by others called Marannon, although Andrew Theuet doeth
affirme that betweene Marannon and Amazones there are 120
leagues: but sure it is that those riuers haue one head and
beginning, and the Marannon, which Theuet describeth, is but a
branch of Amazones or Orellana, of which I will speake more in
another place.
<span class="sidenote">Iuan Martinez the first that euer saw
Manoa.</span>
It was attempted by Ordas; but it is now little
lesse then 70 yeres since that Diego Ordas, a knight of the order
of Saint Iago attempted the same: and it was in the yeere 1542
that Orellana discovered the riuer of Amazones: but
the first that euer saw Manoa was Iuan Martinez
master of the munition to Ordas. At a port called
Morequito in Guiana there lieth at this day a great
anker of Ordas his ship; and this port is some 300 miles within
the land, vpon the great riuer of Orenoque.</p>

<p>I rested at this port foure dayes: twenty dayes after I left the
ships at Curiapan. The relation of this Martinez (who was the
first that discouered Manoa) his successe and ende are to bee
seene in the Chancery of Saint Iuan de Puerto rico, whereof
Berreo had a copy, which appeared to be the greatest incouragement
aswell to Berreo as to others that formerly attempted the
discouery and conquest. Orellana after he failed of the discouery
of Guiana by the sayd riuer of Amazones, passed into
Spaine, and there obteined a patent of the king for the inuasion
and conquest, but died by sea about the Islands, and his fleet
seuered by tempest, the action for that time proceeded
not.
<span class="sidenote">Diego de Ordas went foorth with 600 souldiers

Diego Ordas followed the enterprise, and departed
Spaine with 600 souldiers, and 30 horse,
who arriuing on the coast of Guiana, was slaine
<!--442.png-->
<span class="pagenum">446</span>
in a mutiny, with the most part of such as fauoured
him, as also of the rebellious part, insomuch as his ships
perished, and few or none returned, neither was it certeinly
knowen what became of the sayd Ordas, vntill
Berreo found the anker of his ship in the riuer of Orenoque;
but it was supposed, and so it is written by Lopez, that he
perished on the seas, and of other writers diuersely
conceiued and reported.
<span class="sidenote">Fran. Lopez hist. gen. de las Ind. cap. 87.</span>
And hereof it came that
Martinez entred so farre within the land, and arriued
at that city of Inga the emperour; for it chanced that
while Ordas with his army rested at the port of Morequito (who
was either the first or second that attempted Guiana) by some
negligence, the whole store of powder prouided for the seruice
was set on fire: and Martinez hauing the chiefe charge, was condemned
by the Generall Ordas to be executed foorthwith:
Martinez being much fauoured by the souldiers, had all the
meanes possible procured for his life; but it could not be obteined
in other sort than this: That he should be set into a canao alone
without any victuall, onely with his armes, and so turned loose
into the great riuer: but it pleased God that the canoa was
caried downe the streame, and that certeine of the Guianians
mette it the same euening;
<span class="sidenote">The great city of Manao or El Dorado.</span>
and hauing not at any time seene
any Christian, nor any man of that colour, they caried Martinez
into the land to be woondred at, and so from towne to towne,
vntill he came to the great city of Manoa, the seat
and residence of Inga the emperour. The emperour
after he had beheld him, knew him to be a Christian
(for it was not long before that his brethren Guascar and Atabalipa
were vanquished by the Spanyards in Peru) and caused him
to be lodged in his palace, and well interteined. Hee liued
seuen moneths in Manoa, but was not suffered to wander into
the countrey any where. He was also brought thither all the
way blindfold, led by the Indians, vntill he came to the entrance
of Manoa it selfe, and was fourteene or fifteene dayes in the
passage. He auowed at his death that he entred the city at
Noon, and then they vncouered his face, and that he trauelled
all that day till night thorow the city, and the next day from Sun
rising to Sun setting yer he came to the palace of Inga. After
that Martinez had liued seuen moneths in Manoa, and began to
vnderstand the language of the countrey, Inga asked him whether
he desired to returne into his owne countrey, or would willingly
<!--443.png-->
<span class="pagenum">447</span>
abide with him. But Martinez not desirous to stay, obteined the
fauour of Inga to depart: with whom he sent diuers Guianians
to conduct him to the riuer of Orenoque, all loden with as much
golde as they could cary, which he gaue to Martinez at his departure:
but when he was arriued neere the riuers side, the
borderers which are called Orenoqueponi robbed him and his
Guianians of all the treasure (the borderers being at that time at
warres, which Inga had not conquered) saue only of two great
bottels of gourds, which were filled with beads of golde
curiously wrought, which those Orenoqueponi thought had
bene no other thing then his drinke or meat, or graine for food,
with which Martinez had liberty to passe: and so in canoas hee
fell downe from the riuer of Orenoque to Trinidad, and from
thence to Margarita, and also to Saint Iuan de puerto rico, where
remaining a long time for passage into Spaine, he died. In the
time of his extreme sicknesse, and when he was without
hope of life, receiuing the Sacrament at the hands of his
Confessor, he deliuered these things, with the relation of his
trauels, and also called for his calaba&ccedil;as or gourds of the golde
beads which he gaue to the church and friers to be
prayed for.
<span class="sidenote">The author of the name of El Dorado.</span>
This Martinez was he that Christened
the city of Manoa by the name of El Dorado, and as
Berreo informed mee, vpon this occasion: Those Guianians, and
also the borderers, and all other in that tract which I haue seene
are maruellous great drunkards; in which vice, I thinke no
nation can compare with them: and at the times of their solemne
feasts, when the emperour carowseth with his captaines, tributaries,
and gouernours, the maner is thus: All those that pledge him
are first stripped naked, and their bodies anointed all ouer with
a kind of white balsamum (by them called curca) of which there
is great plenty, and yet very deare amongst them, and it is of all
other the most precious, whereof wee haue had good experience:
when they are anointed all ouer, certeine seruants of the
emperour, hauing prepared golde made into fine powder, blow it
thorow hollow canes vpon their naked bodies, vntill they be all
shining from the foot to the head: and in this sort they sit
drinking by twenties and hundreds, and continue in drunkennesse
sometimes sixe or seuen dayes together.
<span class="sidenote">Sir Robert Duddeley.</span>
The same is also confirmed
by a letter written into Spaine, which was intercepted,
which M. Robert Duddeley tolde me he had seene.
Vpon this sight, and for the abundance of golde
<!--444.png-->
<span class="pagenum">448</span>
which he saw in the city, the images of golde in their
temples, the plates, armours, and shields of gold which they vse
in the warres, he called it El Dorado. After the death of Ordas
and Martinez, and after Orellana, who was imployed by Gonzalo
Pi&ccedil;arro, one Pedro de Osua a knight of Nauarre attempted
Guiana, taking his way from Peru, and built his brigandines vpon
a riuer called Oia, which riseth to the Southward of Quito, and
is very great. This riuer falleth into Amazones, by which Osua
with his companies descended, and came out of that prouince
which is called Mutylonez: and it seemeth to mee that this
empire is reserued for her Maiesty and the English nation, by
reason of the hard successe which all these and other Spanyards
found in attempting the same, whereof I will speake
briefly, though impertinent in some sort to my
purpose.
<span class="sidenote">Reade Iosephus Acosta.</span>
This Pedro de Osua had among his troups
a Biscain, called Agiri, a man meanly borne, who bare no
other office then a sergeant or alferez: but after certaine moneths,
when the souldiers were grieued with trauels, and consumed
with famine, and that no entrance could be found by the
branches or body of Amazones, this Agiri raised a mutiny, of
which hee made himselfe the head, and so preuailed, as he put
Osua to the sword, and all his followers, taking on him the whole
charge and commandement, with a purpose not onely to make himselfe
emperour of Guiana, but also of Peru, and of all that side
of the West Indies: he had of his party seuen hundred souldiers,
and of those many promised to draw in other captaines and
companies, to deliuer vp townes and forts in Peru: but neither
finding by the sayd riuer any passage into Guiana, nor any
possibility to returne towards Peru by the same Amazones, by reason
that the descent of the riuer made so great a current, he was
inforced to disemboque at the mouth of the sayd Amazones, which
can not be lesse then a thousand leagues from the place
where they imbarked: from thence be coasted the land
till he arriued at Margarita:
<span class="sidenote">The voyage of sir Iohn Burgh to the West
Indies.</span>
to the North of Mompatar,
which is at this day called Puerto de Tyranno, for that he
there slew Don Iuan de villa Andreda, gouernour of Margarita
when sir Iohn Burgh landed there and attempted the
Island. Agiri put to the sword all other in the
Island that refused to be of his party, and tooke with
him certeine Simerones, and other desperate companions.
From thence he went to Cumana, and there slew
<!--445.png-->
<span class="pagenum">449</span>
the gouernour, and dealt in all as at Margarita: hee spoiled all
the coast of Caracas, and the prouince of Venezuela, and of Rio
de la hacha; and as I remember, it was the same yere that sir
Iohn Hawkins sailed to Saint Iuan de Vllua in the Iesus of
Lubeck: for himselfe tolde me that he met with such a one vpon
the coast that rebelled, and had sailed downe all the riuer of
Amazones. Agiri from thence landed about Sancta Marta, and
sacked it also, putting to death so many as refused to be his
followers, purposing to inuade Nueuo reyno de Granada, and to
sacke Pamplon, Merida, Lagrita, Tunxa, and the rest of the cities
of Nueuo reyno, and from thence againe to enter Peru: but in a
fight in the sayd Nueuo reyno he was ouerthrowen, and finding
no way to escape, he first put to the sword his owne children,
foretelling them that they should not liue to be defamed or vpbraided
by the Spanyards after his death, who would haue
termed them the children of a traitour or tyrant; and that sithence
hee could not make them princes, hee would yet deliuer
them from shame and reproche. These were the ends and
tragedies of Ordas, Martinez, Oreliana, Ozua, and Agiri.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">1532. Gomar. cap. 84 and 86.</span>
Also soone after Ordas followed Ieronimo Ortal de Saragosa
with 130 souldiers, who failing his entrance by sea,
was cast with the current on the coast of Paria, and
peopled about S. Miguel de Neueri. It was then
attempted by Don Pedro de Silua, a Portugues of the family of
Ruigomes de Silua, and by the fauour which Ruigomes had
with the king, he was set out, but he also shot wide of the marke;
for being departed from Spaine with his fleete, he entered by
Marannon and Amazones, where by the nations of the riuer, and
by the Amazones hee was vttlerly ouerthrowen, and himselfe and
all his armie defeated, only seuen escaped, and of those but two
returned.</p>

<p>After him came Pedro Hernandez de Serpa, and landed at
Cumana in the West Indies, taking his iourney by and towards
Orenoque, which may be some 120 leagues: but ther he came to
the borders of the sayd riuer, hee was set vpon by
a nation of the Indians called Wikiri, and ouerthrowen
in such sort, that of 300 souldiers, horsemen, many Indians, and
Negros, there returned but 18. Others affirme, that he was defeated
in the very entrance of Guiana, at the first ciuil towne of
the empire called Macureguarai. Captaine Preston in taking
S. Iago de Leon (which was by him and his companies very
<!--446.png-->
<span class="pagenum">450</span>
resolutely performed, being a great towne, and farre within the
land) held a gentleman prisoner, who died in his ship, that was
one of the company of Hermandez de Serpa, and saued among
those that escaped, who witnessed what opinion is held among
the Spanyards thereabouts of the great riches of Guiana, and El
Dorado the city of Inga. Another Spanyard was brought aboord
me by captaine Preston, who told me in the hearing of himselfe
and diuers other gentlemen, that he met with Berreos campe-master
at Caracas, when he came from the borders of Guiana,
and that he saw with him forty of most pure plates of golde
curiously wrought, and swords of Guiana decked and inlayed
with gold, feathers garnished with golde and diuers rarities which
he carried to the Spanish king.</p>

<p>After Hernandez de Serpa, it was undertaken by the Adelantado,
Don Gonzales Ximenes de Casada, who was one of the
chiefest in the conquest of Nueuo reino, whose daughter and
heire Don Antonio de Berreo maried. Gonzales sought the
passage also by the riuer called Papamene, which riseth by Quito
in Peru, and runneth Southeast 100 leagues, and then falleth into
Amazones, but he also failing the entrance, returned with the
losse of much labour and cost. I tooke one captaine George
a Spanyard that followed Gonzales in this enterprise. Gonzales
gaue his daughter to Berreo, taking his oth and honour to follow
the enterprise to the last of his substance and life, who since, as
he hath sworne to me, hath spent 300000 ducats in the same,
and yet never could enter so far into the land as my selfe with
that poore troupe or rather a handfull of men, being in all about
100 gentlemen, souldiers, rowers, boat-keepers, boyes, and of all
sorts: neither could any of the forepassed vndertakers, nor
Berreo himselfe, discouer the countrey, till now lately by conference
with an ancient king called Carapana, he got the true
light thereof: for Berreo came about 1500 miles yer he vnderstood
ought, or could finde any passage or entrance into any
part thereof, yet he had experience of al these forenamed, and
diuers others, and was perswaded of their errors and mistakings.
Berreo sought it by the river Cassamar,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> which falleth into a great
riuer called Pato: Pato falleth into Meta, and Meta into Baraquan,
which is also called Orenoque.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a>
Casanare.</div>

<p>He tooke his journey from Nueuo reyno de Granada where he
<!--447.png-->
<span class="pagenum">451</span>
dwelt, hauing the inheritance of Gonzales Ximenes in those
parts: he was followed with 700 horse, he draue with him 1000
head of cattell, he had also many women, Indians, and slaues.
How all these riuers crosse and encounter, how the countrey lieth
and is bordered, the passage of Ximenes and Berreo, mine owne
discouery, and the way that I entred, with all the rest of the
nations and riuers, your lordship shall receiue in a large Chart or
Map, which I haue not yet finished, and which I shall most
humbly pray your lordship to secret, and not to suffer it to passe
your owne hands: for by a draught thereof all may be preuented
by other nations: for I know it is this very yeere sought by the
French, although by the way that they now take, I feare it not
much.
<span class="sidenote">A new and rich trade of the French to the riuer of
Amazones.</span>
It was also tolde me yer I departed from England, that
Villiers the Admirall was in preparation for the
planting of Amazones, to which riuer the French
haue made diuers voyages and returned much golde,
and other rarities. I spake with the captaine of a
French ship that came from thence, his ship riding
in Falmouth the same yere that my ships came first from
Virginia.</p>

<p>There was another this yeere in Helford that also came
from thence, and had bene foureteene moneths at an anker in
Amazones, which were both very rich. Although, as I am perswaded,
Guiana cannot be entred that way, yet no doubt the
trade of gold from thence passeth by branches of riuers into the
riuer of Amazones, and so it doth on euery hand far from the
countrey it selfe; for those Indians of Trinidad haue plates of
golde from Guiana, and those canibals of Dominica which dwell
in the Islands by which our ships passe yerely to the West
Indies, also the Indians of Paria, those Indians called Tucaris,
Chochi, Apotomios, Cumanagotos, and all those other nations
inhabiting neere about the mountaines that run from Paria
thorow the prouince of Venezuela, and in Maracapana, and the
canibals of Guanipa, the Indians called Assawai, Coaca, Aiai,
and the rest (all which shall be described in my description as
they are situate) haue plates of golde of Guiana. And vpon the
riuer of Amazones, Theuet writeth that the people weare
croissants of golde, for of that forme the Guianians most commonly
make them: so as from Dominica to Amazones, which is
aboue 250 leagues, all the chiefe Indians in all parts weare of
those plates of Guiana. Vndoubtedly those that trade Amazones
<!--448.png-->
<span class="pagenum">452</span>
returne much golde, which (as is aforesayd) commeth by trade
from Guiana, by some branch of a riuer that falleth from the
countrey into Amazones, and either it is by the riuer which
passeth by the nations called Tisnados, or by Carepuna. I made
inquiry amongst the most ancient and best travelled of the
Orenoqueponi, and I had knowledge of all the riuers betweene
Orenoque and Amazones, and was very desirous to vnderstand
the truth of those warlike women, because of some it is beleeued,
of others not. And though I digresse from my purpose, yet I
will set downe that which hath bene deliuered me for trueth of
those women, and I spake with a casique or lord of people, that
told me he had bene in the riuer, and beyond it also.
<span class="sidenote">The seat of the Amazones.</span>
The nations of these women are on the South side
of the riuer in the prouinces of Topago, and their
chiefest strengths and retracts are in the Islands situate on the
South side of the entrance some 60 leagues within the mouth of
the sayd riuer. The memories of the like women are very
ancient aswell in Africa and in Asia: In Africa those that had
Medusa for queene: others in Scithia nere the riuers of Tanais
and Thermodon: we finde also that Lampedo and Marthesia
were queenes of the Amazones: in many histories they are
verified to haue bene, and in diuers ages and prouinces: but
they which are not far from Guiana doe accompany with men
but once in a yere, and for the time of one moneth, which I
gather by their relation, to be in April: and that time all kings
of the borders assemble, and queenes of the Amazones: and
after the queenes haue chosen, the rest cast lots for their Valentines.
This one moneth, they feast, dance, and drinke of their
wines in abundance; and the Moone being done, they all depart
to their owne prouinces. If they conceiue, and be deliuered of
a sonne, they returne him to the father; if of a daughter they
nourish it, and reteine it: and as many as haue daughters send
vnto the begetters a present; all being desirous to increase their
owne sex and kind: but that they cut off the right dug of the
brest, I doe not finde to be true. It was farther tolde me, that
if in these warres they tooke any prisoners that they vsed to
accompany with those also at what time soeuer, but in the end
for certeine they put them to death: for they are sayd to be
very cruell and bloodthirsty, especially to such as offer to inuade
their territories. These Amazones haue likewise great store of
these plates of golde, which they recouer by exchange chiefly for
<!--449.png-->
<span class="pagenum">453</span>
a kinde of greene stones, which the Spanyards call Piedras
hijadas, and we vse for spleene stones: and for the disease of
the stone we also esteeme them. Of these I saw diuers in
Guiana: and commonly euery king or casique hath one, which
their wiues for the most part weare: and they esteeme them as
great iewels.</p>

<p>But to returne to the enterprise of Bereo, who (as I haue sayd)
departed from Nueuo reyno with 700 horse, besides the prouisions
aboue rehearsed, he descended by the riuer called
Cassanar, which riseth in Nueuo reyno out of the mountaines by
the city of Tunia, from which mountaine also springeth Pato:
both which fall into the great riuer of Meta: and Meta riseth
from a mountaine ioyning to Pampion in the same Nueuo reyno
de Grenada. These, as also Guaiare, which issueth out of the
mountaines by Timana, fall all into Baraquan, and are but of his
heads: for at their comming together they lose their names:
and Baraquan farther downe is also rebaptized by the name of
Orenoque. On the other side of the city and hilles of Timana
riseth Rio grande, which falleth in the sea by Sancta Marta. By
Cassanar first, and so into Meta, Berreo passed, keeping his
horsemen on the banks, where the countrey serued them for to
march, and where otherwise, he was driuen to imbarke them in
boats which he builded for the purpose, and so came with the
current downe the riuer of Meta, and so into Baraquan. After
he entred that great and mighty riuer, he began dayly to lose of
his companies both men and horse: for it is in many places
violently swift, and hath forcible eddies, many sands, and diuers
Islands sharp pointed with rocks: but after one whole yeere,
iourneying for the most part by riuer and the rest by land, he
grew dayly to fewer numbers: for both by sicknesse, and by
encountring with the people of those regions, thorow which he
trauelled, his companies were much wasted, especially by diuers
encounters with the Amapians: and in all this time hee neuer
could learne of any passage into Guiana, nor any newes or fame
thereof, vntill he came to a further border of the sayd Amapaia,
eight dayes iourney from the riuer Caroli, which was the furthest
riuer that he entred. Among those of Amapaia, Guiana was
famous, but few of these people accosted Berreo, or would trade
with him the first three moneths of the six, which he soiourned
there. This Amapaia is also maruellous rich in golde (as both
Berreo confessed and those of Guiana with whom I had most
<!--450.png-->
<span class="pagenum">454</span>
conference) and is situate vpon Orenoque also. In this countrey
Berreo lost 60 of his best souldiers, and most of all his horse that
remained in his former yeeres trauell: but in the end, after
diuers encounters with those nations, they grew to peace; and
they presented Berreo with tenne images of fine golde among
diuers other plates and croissants, which, as he sware to me and
diuers other gentlemen, were so curiously wrought, as he had
not seene the like either in Italy, Spaine, or the Low countreys:
and he was resolued, that when he came to the hands of the
Spanish king, to whom he had sent them by his camp-master,
they would appeare very admirable, especially being wrought by
such a nation as had no yron instruments at all, nor any of those
helps which our goldsmiths haue to worke withall. The particular
name of the people in Amapaia which gaue him these
pieces, are called Anebas, and the riuer of Orenoque at that place
is aboue 12 English miles broad, which may be from his out fall
into the sea 700 or 800 miles.</p>

<p>This prouince of Amapaia is a very low and a marish ground
nere the riuer; and by reason of the red water which issueth out
in small branches thorow the fenny and boggy ground; there
breed diuers poisonfull wormes and serpents: and the Spanyards
not suspecting, nor in any sort foreknowing the danger, were infected
with a grieuous kinde of fluxe by drinking thereof; and
euen the very horses poisoned therewith: insomuch as at the end
of the 6 moneths, that they abode their, of all there troups, there
were not left aboue 120 souldiers, and neither horse nor cattell:
for Berreo hoped to haue found Guiana by 1000 miles nerer then
it fel out to be in the end: by meanes whereof they sustained
much want and much hunger, oppressed with grieuous diseases,
and all the miseries that could be imagined. I demanded of
those in Guiana that had trauelled Amapaia, how they liued with
that tawny or red water when they trauelled thither: and they
tolde me that after the Sun was neere the middle of the skie,
they vsed to fill their pots and pitchers with that water, but either
before that time, or towardes the setting of the Sun it was dangerous
to drinke of, and in the night strong poison. I learned also of
diuers other riuers of that nature among them, which were also (while
the Sun was in the Meridian) very safe to drinke, and in the
morning, euening, and night woonderfull dangerous and infectiue.
From this prouince Berreo hasted away assoone as the
Spring and beginning of Summer appeared, and sought his
<!--451.png-->
<span class="pagenum">455</span>
entrance on the borders of Orenoque on the South side: but
there ran a ledge of so high and impassable mountaines, as he
was not able by any meanes to march ouer them, continuing
from the East sea into which Orenoque falleth, euen to Quito in
Peru: neither had he meanes to cary victuall or munition ouer
those craggie, high, and fast hilles, being all woody, and those so
thicke and spiny, and so full of prickles, thornes, and briers, as
it is impossible to creepe thorow them: hee had also neither
friendship among the people, nor any interpreter to perswade or
treat with them: and more, to his disaduantage, the casiques and
kings of Amapaia had giuen knowledge of his purpose to the
Guianians, and that he sought to sacke and conquer the empire,
for the hope of their so great abundance and quantities of golde:
he passed by the mouthes of many great riuers, which fell into
Orenoque both from the North and South, which I forbeare to
name for tediousnesse, and because they are more pleasing in
describing then reading.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Many great riuers falling into Orenoque.</span>
Berreo affirmed that there fell an hundred riuers
into Orenoque from the North and South, whereof
the least was as big as Rio grande, that passed
betweene Popayan and Nueuo reyno de Granada (Rio
Grande being esteemed one of the renowmed riuers in all the
West Indies, and numbred among the great riuers of the world:)
but he knew not the names of any of these, but Caroli onely;
neither from what nations they descended, neither to what
prouinces they led: for he had no meanes to discourse with the
inhabitants at any time: neither was he curious in these things,
being vtterly vnlearned, and not knowing the East from the West.
But of all these I got some knowledge, and of many more, partly
by mine owne trauell, and the rest by conference: of some one I
learned one, of others the rest, hauing with me an Indian that
spake many languages, and that of Guiana naturally. I sought
out all the aged men, and such as were greatest travellers, and
by the one and the other I came to vnderstand the situations, the
riuers, the kingdomes from the East sea to the borders of Peru,
and from Orenoque Southward as farre as Amazones or Marannon,
and the religions of Maria Tamball, and of all the kings of
prouinces, and captaines of townes and villages, how they stood
in tearmes of peace or warre, and which were friends or enemies
the one with the other, without which there can be neither
entrance nor conquest in those parts, nor elsewhere: for by the
<!--452.png-->
<span class="pagenum">456</span>
dissention betweene Guascar and Atabalipa, Pi&ccedil;arro conquered
Peru, and by the hatred that the Tlaxcallians have to Mutezuma,
Cortez was victorious ouer Mexico: without which both the one
and the other had failed of their enterprise, and of the great
honour and riches which they atteined vnto.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">The prouince of Emeria inhabited by gentle
Indians.</span>
Now Berreo began to grow into dispaire, and looked for no
other successe then his predecessor in this enterprise,
vntill such time as hee arriued at the prouince of
Emeria towards the East sea and mouth of the riuer,
where he found a nation of people very fauourable,
and the countrey full of all maner of victuall. The
king of this land is called Carapana, a man very wise, subtill, and
of great experience, being little lesse then an hundred yeeres
olde: in his youth he was sent by his father into the Island of
Trinidad, by reason of ciuill warre among themselues, and was
bred at a village in that island, called Parico: at that place in his
youth hee had seene many Christians, both French and Spanish,
and went diuers times with the Indians of Trinidad to Margarita
and Cumana in the West Indies (for both those places haue euer
beene relieued with victuall from Trinidad) by reason whereof he
grew of more vnderstanding, and noted the difference of the
nations, comparing the strength and armes of his countrey with
those of the Christians, and euer after temporized so, as whosoeuer
els did amisse, or was wasted by contention, Carapana kept
himselfe and his countrey in quiet and plenty: he also held
peace with the Caribes or Canibals his neighbours, and had free
trade with all nations, whosoeuer els had warre.</p>

<p>Berreo soiourned and rested his weake troupe in the towne of
Carapana sixe weeks, and from him learned the way and passage
to Guiana, and the riches and magnificence thereof: but being
then vtterly disable to proceed, he determined to try his fortune
another yere, when he had renewed his prouisions, and regathered
more force, which hee hoped for as well out of Spaine
as from Nueuo reyno, where hee had left his sonne Don Antonio
Ximenes to second him vpon the first notice giuen of his entrance,
and so for the present imbarked himselfe in canoas, and by
the branches of Orenoque arriued at Trinidad, hauing from
Carapana sufficient pilots to conduct him. From Trinidad he
coasted Paria, and so recouered Margarita: and hauing made
relation to Don Iuan Sermiento the gouernour, of his proceeding
and perswaded him of the riches of Guiana, he obteined from
<!--453.png-->
<span class="pagenum">457</span>
thence fifty souldiers, promising presently to returne to Carapana,
and so into Guiana. But Berreo meant nothing lesse at that
time: for he wanted many prouisions necessary for such an
enterprise, and therefore departed from Margarita, seated himselfe
in Trinidad, and from thence sent his camp-master, and his
sergeant-maior backe to the borders to discouer the neerest
passage into the empire, as also to treat with the borderers, and
to draw them to his party and loue: without which, he knew he
could neither passe safely, nor in any sort be relieued with
victuall or ought els. Carapana directed his company to a king
called Morequito, assuring them that no man could deliuer so
much of Guiana as Morequito could, and that his dwelling was
but fiue dayes journey from Macureguarai, the first ciuill towne
of Guiana.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Vides the gouernour of Cumana competitor with
Berreo in the conquest of Guiana.</span>
Now your lordship shall vnderstand, that this Morequito, one
of the greatest lords or kings of the borders of Guiana, had two
or three yeeres before bene at Cumana and at Margarita,
in the West Indies, with great store of plates of golde, which he
caried to exchange for such other things as he wanted in his
owne countrey, and was dayly feasted, and presented by the
gouernours of those places, and held amongst them some two
moneths, in which time one Vides gouernour of
Cumana wanne him to be his conductour into
Guiana, being allured by those croissants and images
of golde which hee brought with him to trade, as also
by the ancient fame and magnificence of El Dorado:
whereupon Vides sent into Spaine for a patent to discouer
and conquer Guiana, not knowing of the precedence
of Berreos patent, which, as Berreo affirmeth, was signed
before that of Vides: so as when Vides vnderstood of Berreo,
and that he had made entrance into that territory, and forgone
his desire and hope, it was verily thought that Vides practised
with Morequito to hinder and disturbe Berreo in all he could,
and not to suffer him to enter thorow his signorie, nor any of his
companies; neither to victuall, nor guide them in any sort; for
Vides gouernour of Cumana, and Berreo, were become mortall
enemies, aswell for that Berreo had gotten Trinidad into his
patent with Guiana, as also in that he was by Berreo preuented
in the iourney of Guiana it selfe: howsoeuer it was, I know not,
but Morequito for a time dissembled his disposition, suffered
Spanyards, and a frier (which Berreo had sent to discouer
<!--454.png-->
<span class="pagenum">458</span>
Manoa) to trauell thorow his countrey, gaue them a guide for
Macureguaray, the first towne of ciuill and apparelled people,
from whence they had other guides to bring them to Manoa the
great city of Inga:
<span class="sidenote">Ten Spanyards arriue at Manoa.</span>
and being furnished with those things which
they had learned of Carapana were of most price in Guiana,
went onward, and in eleuen dayes arriued at Manoa,
as Berreo affirmeth for certaine: although I could
not be assured thereof by the lord which now
gouerneth the prouince of Morequito, for he tolde me that they
got all the golde they had, in other townes on this side Manoa,
there being many very great and rich, and (as he sayd) built like
the townes of Christians, with many roomes.</p>

<p>When these ten Spaniards were returned, and ready to put out
of the border of Aromaia, the people of Morequito set vpon
them, and slew them all but one that swam the riuer, and tooke
from them to the value of forty thousand pezos of golde: and
one of them onely liued to bring the newes to Berreo, that both
his nine souldiers and holy father were benighted in the said
prouince. I my selfe spake with the captaines of Morequito that
slew them, and was at the place where it was executed. Berreo,
inraged heerewithall, sent all the strength he could make into
Aromaia, to be reuenged of him, his people, and countrey. But
Morequito suspecting the same, fled ouer Orenoque, and thorow
the territories of the Saima, and Wikiri, recouered Cumana,
where he thought himself very safe, with Vides the gouernour.
But Berreo sending for him in the Kings name, and his
messengers finding him in the house of one Fashardo on the
sudden yer he was suspected, so as he could not then be conueyed
away, Vides durst not deny him, aswell to avoid the
suspition of this practise, as also for that an holy father was slaine
by him and his people.
<span class="sidenote">Morequito executed.</span>
Morequito offered Fashardo the weight
of three quintals in golde, to let him escape: but
the poore Guianian betrayed on all sides was delivered
to the camp-master of Berreo, and was presently
executed.</p>

<p>After the death of this Morequito, the souldiers of Berreo
spoiled his territorie, and tooke diuers prisoners, among others
they tooke the vncle of Morequito, called Topiawari, who is now
king of Aromaia (whose sonne I brought with me into England)
and is a man of great vnderstanding and policy: he is aboue an
hundred yeeres olde, and yet of a very able body. The Spaniards
<!--455.png-->
<span class="pagenum">459</span>
ledde him in a chaine seuenteene dayes, and made him their
guide from place to place betweene his countrey and Emeria, the
prouince of Carapana, aforesayd, and he was at last redeemed for
an hundred plates of golde, and diuers stones called Piedras
Hijadas, or Spleene-stones.
<span class="sidenote">The towne of Carapana is the port of
Guiana.</span>
Now Berreo for executing of
Morequito, and other cruelties, spoiles, and slaughters done in
Armonaia, hath lost the loue of the Orenoqueponi, and all the
borderers, and dare not send any of his souldiers any further into
the land then to Carapana, which he called the port of Guiana:
but from thence by the helpe of Carapana he had
trade further into the countrey, and alwayes appointed
ten Spaniards to reside in Carapanas towne,
by whose fauour, and by being conducted by his
people, those ten searched the countrey thereabouts, aswell for
mines, as for other trades and commodities.</p>

<p>They also haue gotten a nephew of Morequito, whom they
haue Christened, and named Don Iuan, of whom they haue
great hope, endeuouring by all meanes to establish him in the
sayd prouince.
<span class="sidenote">Some fewe Spaniards are now seated in
Dissequebe.</span>
Among many other trades, those Spaniards vsed
canoas to passe to the riuers of Barema, Pawroma,
and Dissequebe, which are on the south side of the
mouth of Orenoque, and there buy women and
children from the Canibals, which are of that barbarous
nature, as they will for three or foure hatchets
sell the sonnes and daughters of their owne brethren and sisters,
and for somewhat more, euen their owne daughters. Hereof the
Spaniards make great profit: for buying a maid of twelue or
thirteene yeres for three or foure hatchets, they sell them againe
at Margarita in the West Indies for fifty and an hundred pezos,
which is so many crownes.</p>

<p>The master of my shippe, Iohn Dowglas, tooke one of the
canoas which came laden from thence with people to be solde,
and the most of them escaped: yet of those he brought, there
was one as well fauoured, and as well shaped as euer I saw any
in England, afterward I saw many of them, which but for their
tawnie colour may be compared to any of Europe. They also
trade in those riuers for bread of Cassaui, of which they buy an
hundred pound weight for a knife, and sell it at Margarita for ten
pezos. They also recouer great store of Cotton, Brasill wood,
and those beds which they call Hamcas or Brasill beds, wherein
in hot countreyes all the Spaniards vse to lie commonly, and in
<!--456.png-->
<span class="pagenum">460</span>
no other, neither did we our selues while we were there. By
meanes of which trades, for ransome of diuers of the Guianians,
and for exchange of hatchets and kniues, Berreo recouered some
store of golde plates, eagles of golde, and images of men and
diuers birdes, and dispatched his campe-master for Spaine, with
all that hee had gathered, therewith to leuie souldiers, and by the
shew thereof to draw others to the loue of the enterprise. And
hauing sent diuers images aswell of men as beasts, birds and
fishes, so curiously wrought in gold, he doubted not but to
perswade the king to yeeld to him some further helpe, especially
for that this land had neuer beene sacked, the mines neuer
wrought, and in the Indies their works were well spent, and the
golde drawen out with great labour and charge. He also dispatched
messengers to his sonne in Nueuo reyno to leuie all the
forces he could, and to come downe the riuer Orenoque to
Emeria, the prouince of Carapana, to meet him: he had also
sent to Saint Iago de Leon on the coast of the Caracas, to buy
horses and mules.</p>

<p>After I had thus learned of his proceedings past and purposed,
I told him that I had resolued to see Guiana, and that it was the
end of my iourney, and the cause of my comming to Trinidad,
as it was indeed, (and for that purpose I sent Iacob Whiddon the
yeere before to get intelligence with whom Berreo himselfe had
speech at that time, and remembred how inquisitiue Iacob
Whiddon was of his proceedings, and of the countrey of Guiana)
Berreo was stricken into a great melancholy and sadnesse, and
vsed all the arguments he could to disswade me, and also assured
the gentlemen of my company that it would be labour lost, and
that they should suffer many miseries if they proceeded. And
first he deliuered that I could not enter any of the riuers with
any barke or pinnesse, or hardly with any ships boat, it was so
low, sandy, and full of flats, and that his companies were dayly
grounded in their canoas, which drew but twelue inches water.
He further sayde, that none of the countrey would come to
speake with vs, but would all flie: and if we followed them to
their dwellings, they would burne their owne townes: and besides
that, the way was long, the Winter at hand, and that the riuers
beginning once to swell, it was impossible to stem the current,
and that we could not in those small boats by any means cary
victuall for halfe the time, and that (which indeed most discouraged
my company) the kings and lords of all the borders of
<!--457.png-->
<span class="pagenum">461</span>
Guiana had decreed that none of them should trade with any
Christians for golde, because the same would be their owne
ouerthrow, and that for the loue of gold the Christians meant to
conquer and dispossesse them of all together.</p>

<p>Many and the most of these I found to be true, but yet I
resoluing to make triall of all whatsoever happened, directed
Captaine George Gifford my vice-admirall to take the Lions
whelpe, and captaine Calfield his barke to turne to the Eastward,
against the mouth of a riuer called Capuri, whose entrance I had
before sent captaine Whiddon, and Iohn Dowglas the master, to
discouer, who found some nine foot water or better vpon the
flood, and fiue at low water, to whom I had giuen instructions
that they should anker at the edge of the shoald, and vpon the
best of the flood to thrust ouer, which shoald Iohn Dowglas
bwoyed and beckoned for them before: but they laboured in
vaine: for neither could they turne it vp altogether so farre to
the East, neither did the flood continue so long, but
the water fell yer they could haue passed the sands:
as wee after found by a second experience; so as now
wee must either give ouer our enterprise, or leauing our ships at
aduenture foure hundred mile behinde vs, must run vp in our
ships boats, one barge, and two wheries. But being doubtfull
how to cary victuals for so long a time in such bables, or any
strength of men, especially for that Berreo assured vs that his
sonne must be by that time come downe with many souldiers. I
sent away one King, master of the Lions whelpe, with his shipboat
to trie another branch of a riuer in the bottome of the bay
of Guanipa, which was called Amana, to prooue if there were
water to be found for either of the small ships to enter. But
when he came to the mouth of Amana, he found it as the rest,
but stayed not to discouer it thorowly, because he was assured by
an Indian, his guide, that the Canibals of Guanipa would assaile
them with many canoas, and that they shot poisoned arrowes: so
as if he hasted not backe, they should all be lost.</p>

<p>In the mean time, fearing the woorst, I caused all the carpenters
we had, to cut downe a Galego boat, which we meant
to cast off, and to fit her with banks to row on, and in all things
to prepare her the best they could, so as she might be brought to
draw but fiue foot, for so much we had on the barre of Capuri at
low water. And doubting of Kings returne, I sent Iohn Dowglas
againe in my long barge, aswell to relieue him, as also to make a
<!--458.png-->
<span class="pagenum">462</span>
perfect search in the bottome of that bay: for it hath bene held
for infallible, that whatsoeuer ship or boat shall fall therein, can
neuer disembogue againe, by reason of the violent current which
setteth into the sayde-bay, as also for that the brize and Easterly
winde bloweth directly into the same. Of which opinion I haue
heard Iohn Hampton of Plymmouth, one of the greatest experience
of England, and diuers other besides that haue traded to
Trinidad.</p>

<p>I sent with Iohn Dowglas an old casique of Trinidad for a
pilot, who tolde vs that we could not returne againe by the bay
or gulfe, but that he knew a by-branch which ran within the land
to the Eastward, and that he thought by it we might fall into
Capuri, and so returne in foure dayes. Iohn Dowglas searched
those riuers, and found foure goodly entrances, whereof the least
was as bigge as the Thames at Wolwich; but in the bay thitherward
it was shoald, and but sixe foote water: so as we were now
without hope of any ship or barke to passe ouer, and therefore
resolued to go on with the boats, and the bottome of the Galego,
in which we thrust 60 men. In the Lions whelps boat and
whery we caried 20. Captaine Calfield in his whery caried ten
more, and in my barge other tenne, which made vp a hundred:
we had no other meanes but to cary victuall for a moneth in the
same, and also to lodge therein as we could, and to boile and
dresse our meat. Captaine Gifford had with him master Edward
Porter, captaine Eynos, and eight more in his whery, with all
their victuall, weapons, and prouisions. Captaine Calfield had
with him my cousin Butshead Gorges, and eight more. In the
galley, of gentlemen and officers my selfe had captaine Thin, my
cousin Iohn Greenuile, my nephew Iohn Gilbert, captaine
Whiddon, captaine Keymis, Edward Handcocke, captaine Clarke,
lieutenant Hewes, Thomas Vpton, captaine Facy, Ierome Ferrar,
Anthony Welles, William Connocke, and aboue fifty more. We
could not learne of Berreo any other way to enter but in branches,
so farre to wind-ward, as it was impossible for vs to recouer: for
wee had as much sea to crosse ouer in our wheries, as betweene
Douer and Calais, and in a great billow, the winde and current
being both very strong, so as we were driuen to goe in those
small boats directly before the winde into the bottome of the
bay of Guanipa, and from thence to enter the mouth of some
one of those riuers which Iohn Dowglas had last discouered, and
had with vs for pilot an Indian of Barema, a riuer to the South
<!--459.png-->
<span class="pagenum">463</span>
of Orenoque, betweene that and Amazones, whose canoas we
had formerly taken as hee was going from the sayd Barema,
laden with Cassaui-bread, to sell at Margarita. This Arwacan
promised to bring me into the great riuer of Orenoque, but
indeed of that which he entred he was vtterly ignorant, for he
had not seene it in twelue yeeres before: at which time he was
very yoong, and of no iudgement:
<span class="sidenote">A wonderfull confluence of streames.</span>
and if God had not sent vs
another helpe, we might haue wandred a whole yere in that
labyrinth of riuers, yer wee had found any way, either out or in,
especially after wee were past ebbing and flowing which was in
foure dayes, for I know all the earth doeth not yeelde the like
confluence of streames and branches, the one crossing
the other so many times, and all so faire and large,
and so like one to another, as no man can tell which
to take: and if wee went by the Sunne or Compasse,
hoping thereby to goe directly one way or other, yet that way
wee were also caried in a circle amongst multitudes of Islands,
and euery Island so bordered with high trees, as no man coulde
see any further then the bredth of the riuer, or length of the
breach. But this it chanced, that entering into a riuer, (which
because it had no name, wee called the riuer of the Red crosse,
our selues being the first Christians that euer came therein) the
two and twentieth of May, as wee were rowing vp the same, wee
espied a small canoa with three Indians, which (by the swiftnesse
of my barge, rowing with eight oares) I ouertooke yer they
could crosse the riuer, the rest of the people on the banks
shadowed vnder the thicke wood, gazed on with a doubtfull conceit
what might befall those three which we had taken. But
when they perceiued that we offered them no violence, neither
entred their canoa with any of ours, nor tooke out of the canoa
any of theirs, they then beganne to shew themselues on the banks
side, and offered to traffique with vs for such things as they had.
And as wee drew neere, they all stayed, and we came with our
barge to the mouth of a little creeke which came from their
towne into the great riuer.</p>

<p>As we abode there a while, our Indian pilot, called Ferdinando,
would needs goe ashore their village to fetch some fruits, and to
drinke of their artificiall wines, and also to see the place, and
know the lord of it against another time, and tooke with him a
brother of his, which hee had with him in the iourney: when
they came to the village of these people the lord of the Island
<!--460.png-->
<span class="pagenum">464</span>
offered to lay hands on them, purposing to haue slaine them
both, yeelding for reason that this Indian of ours had brought a
strange nation into their territory, to spoile and destroy them.
But the pilot being quicke, and of a disposed body, slipt their
fingers, and ran into the woods, and his brother being the better
footman of the two, recouered the creekes mouth, where we
stayed in our barge, crying out that his brother was slaine: with
that we set hands on one of them that was next vs, a very olde
man, and brought him into the barge, assuring him that if we had
not our pilot againe, we would presently cut off his head. This
olde man being resolued that he should pay the losse of the
other, cried out to those in the woods to saue Ferdinando our
pilot: but they followed him notwithstanding, and hunted after
him vpon the foot with the Deere-dogges, and with so maine a
crie, that all the woods eckoed with the shout they made: but
at the last this poore chased Indian recouered the riuer side, and
got vpon a tree, and as we were coasting, leaped downe and
swamme to the barge halfe dead with feare. But our good
happe was, that we kept the other olde Indian which we handfasted
to redeeme our pilot withall: for being naturall of those
riuers, we assured our selues hee knew the way better then any
stranger could. And indeed, but for this chance, I thinke we
had neuer found the way either to Guiana, or backe to our ships:
for Ferdinando after a few dayes knew nothing at all, nor which
way to turne, yea and many times the old man himselfe was in
great doubt which riuer to take. Those people which dwell in
these broken islands and drowned lands, are generally called
Tiuitiuas: there are of them two sorts, the one called Ciawani,
and the other Waraweete.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">A description of the mighty riuer of Orenoque or
Baraquan.</span>
The great riuer of Orenoque or Baraquan hath nine branches
which fall out on the North side of his owne maine
mouth: on the South side it hath seuen other
fallings into the sea, so it disemboqueth by sixteene
armes in all, betweene Ilands and broken ground, but
the Ilands are very great, many of them as bigge as
the Isle of Wight, and bigger, and many lesse. From the first
branch on the North to the last of the South, it is at least 100
leagues, so as the riuers mouth is 300 miles wide at his entrance
into the sea, which I take to be farre bigger then that of
Amazones. All those that inhabit in the mouth of this riuer
vpon the seuerall North branches, are these Tiuitiuas, of which
<!--461.png-->
<span class="pagenum">465</span>
there are two chiefe lords which haue continuall warres one with
the other. The Ilands which lie on the right hand, are called
Pallamos, and the land on the left, Horotomaka, and the riuer
by which Iohn Douglas returned within the land from Amana to
Capuri, they call Macuri.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">What maner of people the Tiuitiuas are.</span>
These Tiuitiuas are a very goodly people and very
valiant, and haue the most manly speech and most
deliberate that euer I heard, of what nation soeuer.
In the Summer they haue houses on the ground, as in other
places: in the Winter they dwell vpon the trees, where
they build very artificiall townes and villages, as it is written in
the Spanish story of the West Indies, that those people do in the
low lands nere the gulfe of Vraba: for betweene May and
September the riuer of Orenoque riseth thirty foot vpright, and
then are those ilands ouerflowen twenty foot high aboue the
leuell of the ground, sauing some few raised grounds in the
middle of them: and for this cause they are inforced to liue in
this maner. They neuer eat of any thing that is set or sowen:
and as at home they vse neither planting nor other manurance,
so when they come abroad, they refuse to feed of ought, but of
that which nature without labour bringeth forth. They vse the
tops of Palmitos for bread, and kill deere, fish, and porks,
for the rest of their sustenance. They haue also many sorts of
fruits that grow in the woods, and great variety of birds and
fowle.</p>

<p>And if to speake of them were not tedious, and vulgar, surely
we saw in those passages of very rare colours and formes, not
elsewhere to be found, for as much as I haue either seene or
read. Of these people those that dwell vpon the branches
of Orenoque, called Capuri and Macureo, are for the most
part carpenters of canoas, for they make the most and fairest
canoas, and sel them into Guiana for golde, and into Trinidad for
tobacco in the excessiue taking whereof, they exceed all nations:
and not withstanding the moistnesse of the aire in which they
liue, the hardnesse of their diet, and the great labours
they suffer to hunt, fish and fowle for their liuing in all my life,
either in the Indies or in Europe, did I neuer behold a more goodly
or better fauoured people or a more manly. They were woont to
make warre vpon all nations, especially on the Canibals, so as none
durst without a good strength trade by those riuers: but of late
they are at peace with their neighbours, all holding the Spaniards
<!--462.png-->
<span class="pagenum">466</span>
for a common enemy. When their commanders die, they vse
great lamentation, and when they thinke the flesh of their bodies
is petrified, and fallen from the bones, then they take vp the
carcase againe, and hang it in the caciques house that died, and
decke his scull with feathers of all colours, and hang all his
golde plates about the bones of his armes, thighs, and legs.
Those nations which are called Arwacas, which dwell on the
South of Orenoque, (of which place and nation our Indian pilot
was) are dispersed in many other places, and doe vse to beat the
bones of their lords into powder, and their wiues and friends
drinke it all in their seuerall sorts of drinks.</p>

<p>After we departed from the port of these Ciawani, wee passed
vp the riuer with the flood, and ankered the ebbe, and in this
sort we went onward. The third day that we entred the riuer,
our galley came on ground, and stucke so fast, as we thought that
euen there our discouery had ended, and that we must haue left
fourescore and ten of our men to haue inhabited like rooks vpon
trees with those nations: but the next morning, after we had cast
out all her ballast, with tugging and halling to and fro, we got her
aflote, and went on. At foure dayes end wee fell into as goodly
a riuer as euer I beheld, which was called The great Amana,
which ranne more directly without windings and turnings then
the other: but soone after the flood of the sea left vs; and being
inforced either by maine strength to row against a violent current,
or to returne as wise as we went out, we had then no shift
but to perswade the companies that it was but two or three
dayes worke, and therefore desired them to take
paines, euery gentleman and others taking their turnes to row,
and to spell one the other at the houres end. Euery day we
passed by goodly branches of riuers, some falling from the West,
others from the East into Amana, but those I leaue to the description
in the Cart of discouery, where euery one shalbe named
with his rising and descent. When three dayes more were ouergone,
our companies began to despaire, the weather being
extreame hote, the riuer bordered with very high trees, that kept
away the aire, and the current against vs euery day stronger then
other: but we euermore commanded our pilots to promise an
ende the next day, and vsed it so long, as we were driuen to
assure them from foure reaches of the riuer to three, and so to
two, and so to the next reach: but so long we laboured, that
many dayes were spent, and wee driuen to drawe our selues to
<!--463.png-->
<span class="pagenum">467</span>
harder allowance, our bread euen at the last, and no drinke at
all; and our men and our selues so wearied and scorched, and
doubtfull withall, whether wee should euer performe it or no, the
heat increasing as we drew towards the line: for wee were now
in fiue degrees.</p>

<p>The further we went on (our victuall decreasing and the aire
breeding great faintnesse) wee grew weaker and weaker, when
wee had most need of strength and abilitie: for hourely the riuer
ranne more violently then other against vs, and the barge,
wheries, and shippes boat of captaine Gifford and captaine
Calfield, had spent all their prouisions: so as we were brought
into despaire and discomfort, had wee not perswaded all the
company that it was but onely one dayes worke more to atteine
the land where wee should be relieued of all wee wanted, and if
we returned, that wee were sure to starue by the way, and that
the world would also laugh vs to scorne. On the banks of these
riuers were diuers sorts of fruits good to eat, flowers and trees of
such variety, as were sufficient to make tenne volumes of herbals:
we relieued our selues many times with the fruits of the
countrey, and sometimes with fowle and fish. Wee saw birds
of all colours, some carnation, some crimson, orenge-tawny,
purple, watchet and of all other sorts both simple and mixt, and
it was vnto vs a great good passing of the time to beholde them,
besides the reliefe we found by killing some store of them with
our fowling pieces: without which, hauing little or no bread, and
lesse drinke, but onely the thicke and troubled water of the
riuer, we had beene in a very hard case.</p>

<p>Our olde pilot of the Ciawani (whom, as I sayd before, wee
tooke to redeeme Ferdinando) tolde vs, that if we would enter a
branch of a riuer on the right hand with our barge and wheries,
and leaue the galley at anker the while in the great riuer, he
would bring vs to a towne of the Arwacas, where we should finde
store of bread, hennes, fish, and of the countrey wine; and perswaded
vs that departing from the galley at noone, we might
returne yer night. I was very glad to heare this speech, and
presently tooke my barke, with eight musketiers, captaine
Giffords whery, with myselfe and foure musketiers and Captaine
Calfield with his whery, and as many; and so we entred the
mouth of this riuer: and because we were perswaded that it was
so nere, we tooke no victuall with vs at all. When we had rowed
three houres, we maruelled we saw no signe of any dwelling, and
<!--464.png-->
<span class="pagenum">468</span>
asked the pilot where the towne was: he tolde vs a little further.
After three houres more, the Sun being almost set, we began to
suspect that he led vs that way to betray vs; for hee confessed
that those Spaniards which fled from Trinidad, and also those
that remained with Carapana in Emeria, were ioyned together in
some village vpon that riuer. But when it grew towards night;
and wee demanded where the place was: hee tolde vs but foure
reaches more. When we had rowed foure and foure, we saw no
signe; and our poore water-men, euen heart-broken, and tired,
were ready to giue up the ghost: for we had now come from the
galley neere forty miles.</p>

<p>At the last we determined to hang the pilot; and if wee had
well knowen the way backe againe by night, we had surely gone;
but our owne necessities pleaded sufficiently for his safety: for it
was as darke as pitch, and the riuer began so to narrow it
selfe, and the trees to hang ouer from side to side, as wee were
driuen with arming swords to cut a passage thorow those
branches that couered the water. Wee were very desirous to
finde this towne, hoping of a feast, because wee made but a short
breakefast aboord the galley in the morning and it was now
eight a clocke at night, and our stomacks began to gnawe apace:
but whether it was best to returne or goe on, we beganne to
doubt, suspecting treason in the pilot more and more: but the poore
olde Indian euer assured vs that it was but a little further, but
this one turning and that turning: and at the last about one a clocke
after midnight wee saw a light; and rowing towards it, wee
heard the dogges of the village. When we landed wee found
few people; for the lord of that place was gone with diuers
canoas aboue foure hundred miles off, vpon a iourney towardes
the head of Orenoque to trade for golde, and to buy women of
the Canibals, who afterward vnfortunately passed by vs as wee
rode at an anker in the port of Morequito in the darke of the
night, and yet came so neere vs, as his canoas grated against our
barges: he left one of his company at the port of Morequito, by
whom wee vnderstood that hee had brought thirty yoong women,
diuers plates of golde, and had great store of fine pieces of
cotton cloth, and cotton beds. In his house we had good store
of bread, fish, hennes, and Indian drinke, and so rested that
night, and in the morning after we had traded with such of his
people as came downe, we returned towards our gally, and
brought with vs some quantity of bread, fish, and hennes.</p>

<p><!--465.png--><span class="pagenum">469</span>
<span class="sidenote">A most beautifull countrey.</span>
On both sides of this riuer we passed the most beautifull
countrey that euer mine eyes beheld: and whereas
all that we had seene before was nothing but woods,
prickles, bushes, and thornes, here we beheld plaines
of twenty miles in length, the grasse short and greene, and in
diuers parts groues of trees by themselues, as if they had beene
by all the arte and labour in the world so made of purpose: and
still as we rowed, the deere came downe feeding by the waters
side, as if they had beene vsed to a keepers call.
<span class="sidenote">The riuer of Lagartos, or Crocodiles.</span>
Vpon this
riuer there were great store of fowle, and of many sorts: we saw
in it diuers sorts of strange fishes, and of maruellous bignes: but
for lagartos it exceeded, for there were thousands of those vgly
serpents; and the people call it for the abundance
of them, The riuer of Lagartos, in their language. I
had a Negro a very proper yoong fellow, who leaping
out of the galley to swim in the mouth of this riuer, was in all
our sights taken and deuoured with one of those lagartos. In
the meane while our companies in the gally thought we had bene
all lost, (for wee promised to returne before night) and sent the
Lions whelps shippes boat with captaine Whiddon to follow vs
vp the riuer; but the next day, after we had rowed vp and downe
some fourescore miles, we returned, and went on our way, vp the
great riuer; and when we were euen at the last cast for want of
victuals, captaine Gifford being before the galley and the rest of
the boats, seeking out some place to land vpon the banks to
make fire, espied foure canoas comming downe the riuer;
<span class="sidenote">Two canoas taken.</span>
and
with no small ioy caused his men to trie the vttermost of their
strengths, and after a while two of the foure gaue ouer, and
ranne themselues ashore, euery man betaking himselfe to the
fastnesse of the woods, the two other lesser got away, while he
landed to lay hold on these: and so turned into some
by-creeke, we knew not whither.
<span class="sidenote">Three Spanyards escaped.</span>
Those canoas that
were taken, were loaden with bread, and were bound
for Margarita in the West Indies, which those Indians (called
Arwacas) purposed to cary thither for exchange: but in the
lesser there were three Spanyards, who hauing heard
of the defeat of their gouernour in Trinidad, and that
we purposed to enter Guiana, came away in those
canoas: one of them was a cauallero; as the captaine of the
Arwacas after tolde vs, another a souldier, and the third a refiner.</p>
